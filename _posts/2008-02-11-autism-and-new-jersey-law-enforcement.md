Over the weekend, [Kristina Chew](http://www.b5media.com/kristina-chew/) wrote about yet [another tasing of an autistic teenager](http://www.autismvox.com/tased/), and mentions a bill in New Jersey to promote [autism training for first responders](http://www.autismvox.com/nj-bill-to-promote-autism-training-for-first-responders/). While that bill makes its way through the New Jersey state legislature, first responders in Hillsborough, NJ are taking the initiative getting the training for themselves. 

From [Cops learn about autism to help prevent tragedy](http://www.c-n.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080211/NEWS/802110328):  
<span class="mainstory"></span>

> <span class="mainstory">With more than 1,200 children and adults diagnosed with autism in the township &#8212; and thousands more in neighboring communities &#8212; Hillsborough police officers are reaching out to better serve those families during serious law-enforcement situations.</span>
> 
> <span class="mainstory">Hillsborough police Chief Paul Kaminsky recently participated in a four-hour seminar, &#8220;Autism Shield Program for Autism Recognition and Response.&#8221; Its goal: To educate police officers and first-responders with an awareness and understanding of autism and how to teach and live with those affected, said Gary Weitzen, executive director of Parents of Autistic Children, also known as POAC.</span>

<span class="mainstory"></span>

Some thoughts from Chief Kaminsky and what his department is trying to do:

<span class="mainstory"></p> 

<blockquote>
  <p>
    &#8220;All of our officers (there are 56 law-enforcement officers in the Hillsborough Police Department) have been trained concerning identifying and dealing with individuals with autism,&#8221; Kaminsky said. &#8220;With autism being a part of our community and school system, we thought it was important that all our officers be thoroughly trained with the recognition and proper response with people with autism.&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As a result, Hillsborough&#8217;s police department recently has developed an Emergency Data Information base, which allows parents or guardians of special-needs children (and adults) to voluntarily complete a data sheet and return it to the police department.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Emergency Data Sheet then provides law-enforcement officers with &#8220;essential information&#8221; &#8212; such as basic identifying information; emergency contact information; means of communication; best way to interact; specific fears or concerns the person might have when approached; sensory or medical issues; and attractions.
  </p>

  If you haven&#8217;t already, you should think about giving your local PD and FD a call and see what they are doing in this regard, and what you can do to help.
