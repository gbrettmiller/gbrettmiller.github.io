Reading all the different descriptions in various news stories this week, I noticed that almost all of the stories stated, &#8220;There is no cure for autism&#8221; (or something very similar). What a downer. Talk about something that just drains your hope. **NO CURE**. That sucks.

But I don&#8217;t believe that&#8217;s true. What these reports should be saying is, &#8220;There is no **known** cure.&#8221; Sure it&#8217;s still depressing, but at least there is room for hope for those parents and sufferers who are seeking a cure.
