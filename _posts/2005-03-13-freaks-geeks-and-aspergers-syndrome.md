A while back I came across <a HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1843100983/gbrettmiller-20">Freaks, Geeks and Asperger Syndrome: A User Guide to Adolescence</a> by [Luke Jackson](http://www.jkp.com/catalogue/author.php?id=877), a thirteen year old boy diagnosed with Asperger&#8217;s. If you are at all interested in Asperger&#8217;s, especially if you are trying to get in the Asperger&#8217;s afflicted mind, this is an excellent resource.

There are many insights in the book, and I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll come back to it many times. One early on deals with what makes something an obsession (typically considered bad) instead of a passion (typically considered not bad). Here is what Luke has to say on the matter:

> Q: When is an obsession not an obsession?  
> A: When it is about football.
> 
> How unfair is that?! It seems that our society fully accepts the fact that a lot of men and boys &#8216;eat, sleep and breathe&#8217; football and people seem to think that if someone doesn&#8217;t, then they are not fully male. Stupid!
> 
> Girls are lucky enough to escape this football mania but I have noticed that teenage girls have to know almost every word of every song in the charts and who sang what and who is the fittest guy going, so I suppose an AS girl (or a non-AS one) that had interests other than that is likely to experience the same difficulties as a non-football crazy boy.
> 
> I am sure that if a parent went to a doctor and said that their teenage son wouldn&#8217;t shut up about football, they would laugh and tell them that it was perfectly normal. _**It seems as if we all have to be the same.**_ (my emphasis)
