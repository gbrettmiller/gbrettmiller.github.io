One of the more difficult parts of replacing a [blog](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com) (or, in my case, [two](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com)) with a new one is how to keep your current readers informed about the change and, ideally, how to keep them subscribed.  Fortunately, [FeedBurner](http://www.feedburner.com) has made this easy for me (or would have, if I had paid attention!).

[<img title="FeedBurner logo" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.feedburner.com/fb/i/flamocon_190h.gif?resize=141%2C150" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="141" height="150" align="right" data-recalc-dims="1" />](http://www.feedburner.com)Since my blog [29 Marbles](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com) was specific to autism, it was straightforward enough; I simply changed the feed title and the feed details to reflect the autism category feed.  Before I did this, though, I wrote [one last post](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com/2008/11/putting-away-my-29-marbles/) letting my readers know of the change.  I also informed the admins of the sites that aggregate that feed so they could decide if they wanted to continue to include my writing about autism.

It wasn&#8217;t quite as easy with [No Straight Lines](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com), though in retrospect it should have been.  Due to technical issues, I&#8217;m unable to post anything new.  So instead of just switching the feed, like I did for 29 Marbles, I created a new feed.  As Tony pointed out to me a couple of days later, though, no one knew about the new feed (or the new blog, for that matter).  As an interim, I bookmarked my [initial post here](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/my-new-wastebook/) in [delicious](http://delicious.com).  My [delicious feed](http://delicious.com/gbrettmiller) is spliced into my feed by FeedBurner (thank you, again, FeedBurner), so I figured my subscribers would get the word that way.  And then I finally figured out I should simply update the original NSL feed to point to this new blog.

Lessons learned:  Use FeedBurner (or something similar), it really helps when you need to make changes; don&#8217;t forget about your current readers when you make changes; and no matter how well you think you&#8217;ve planned ahead, even for something relatively simple, keep in mind that you will always forget or overlook something.
