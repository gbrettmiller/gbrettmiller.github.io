excerpt: The New York Times today writes about the new gamer generation in Retirees Discover Video Games. Yep, retirees. They are making up a larger and larger part of the market for "casual" games, and game developers and distributors are taking notice. The Nintendo Wii, with its simple controls for many games, is making a splash of its own.

The New York Times today writes about the new gamer generation in [Retirees Discover Video Games](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/30/arts/30seni.html?pagewanted=2&ref=arts "Retirees Discover Video Games - New York Times"). Yep, retirees. They are making up a larger and larger part of the market for &#8220;casual&#8221; games, and game developers and distributors are taking notice. The [Nintendo Wii](http://www.nintendo.com/channel/wii "Nintendo.com:  Wii"), with its simple controls for many games, is making a splash of its own.

My favorite part of the article is that told by semi-retired businessman Dick Norwood:

<blockquote cite="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/30/arts/30seni.html?pagewanted=2&ref=arts" title="NYT - Retirees Discover Video Games">
  <p>
    Dick Norwood, 61, a semi-retired businessman who lives in a community for residents 55 and older in Crest Hill, Ill., spotted the <a title="Nintendo Wii" href="http://www.nintendo.com/channel/wii">Wii</a> in a mall in December. After playing <a title="Nintendo.com Games:  Wii Sports" href="http://www.nintendo.com/gamemini?gameid=1OTtO06SP7M52gi5m8pD6CnahbW8CzxE">Wii bowling</a> with two other couples at home, he persuaded Giovan’s, a local Italian restaurant, to begin a “seniors only” Wii bowling league, where nine couples now show up every Thursday.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    “When I started calling people about it, they had no idea what I was talking about, and they were laughing at me saying, ‘You want to start a bowling league on a video game in a bar?’ ” he said. “Well, we got there the first time, and we were there for six solid hours. In the past, I probably would have agreed that video games are just for kids. But I’ll tell you, at our age when you bowl for real, you wake up with aches and pains. Those balls aren’t light. But with this you’re getting good exercise, but you’re not aching the next day.”

Regular readers here know my fondness for the Wii, and I&#8217;m not the only one. My wife, my brothers, even my mom love to play games on the Wii, especially Wii Sports. The appeal of the Wii, especially in a sports game, is captured by Steven Johnson, author of [Everything Bad is Good For You](http://astore.amazon.com/gbrettmiller-20/detail/1594481946/002-9091504-7932015 "amazon:  Everything Bad is Good for You by Steven Johnson"), in [5 Thoughts on the Nintendo Wii](http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/2007/02/five_thoughts_o.html "stevenberlinjohnson.com:  Five Thoughts on the Nintendo Wii"):

    What strikes you immediately playing Wii Sports &#8212; and particularly Tennis &#8212; is this feeling of fluidity, the feeling that subtle, organic shifts in your body&#8217;s motion will lead to different results onscreen. My wife has a crosscourt slam she hits at the net that for the life of me I haven&#8217;t been able to figure out; I have a topspin return of soft serves that I&#8217;ve half-perfected that&#8217;s unhittable. We both got to those techniques through our own athletic experimentation with various gestures, and I&#8217;m not sure I could even fully explain what I&#8217;m doing with my killer topspin shot.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In a traditional game, I&#8217;d know exactly what I was doing: hitting the B button, say, while holding down the right trigger. Instead, my expertise with the shot has evolved through the physical trial-and-error of swinging the controller, experimenting with different gestures and timings. And that&#8217;s ultimately what&#8217;s so amazing about the device.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Games for years have borrowed the structures and rules &#8212; as well as the imagery &#8212; of athletic competition, but the Wii adds something genuinely new to the mix, something we&#8217;d ignored so long we stopped noticing that it was missing: athleticism itself.

_Update:  For every silver lining, there is apparently a cloud, including for the Nintendo Wii.  The physical exertion that makes the Wii so fun seems to be leading to an increased risk of physical injuries, as described in [Virtual video games cause real injuries](http://www.fairviewobserver.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070329/NEWS07/703290388/1321/MTCN06).  Just like all games, people need to learn to play in moderation._
