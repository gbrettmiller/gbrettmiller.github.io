On today&#8217;s [Leonard Lopate Show](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/lopate/episodes/04042005) on [WYNC](http://www.wnyc.org), Leonard spoke with David Kirby, author of **[Evidence of Harm](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312326440/gbrettmiller-20)**: 

> Bad Medicine?
> 
> David Kirby investigates the side effects of thimerosal&#8211;a preservative used in vaccines that contains mercury. Noting that the use of this preservative coincided with an upsurge of reported cases of autism amongst American children in the 1990s, he looks into whether these vaccines directly hurt children, and who should be held accountable if they did, in Evidence of Harm. 

You can [listen to the discussion](http://www.wnyc.org/stream/ram.py?file=/lopate/lopate040405a.ra) in Real Audio format or get it (and other things from WNYC) via podcast.

If you are in the NYC area, you can see David Kirby speak at the [92d Street Y](http://www.92y.org), Makor Steinhart Center Division on Wednesday at noon.
