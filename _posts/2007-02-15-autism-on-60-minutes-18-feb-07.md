I&#8217;ve already set the DVR to record this. Though the [teaser article](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/02/15/60minutes/main2483414.shtml "Diagnosis: Autism - Latest Weapons Are Early Detection and Treatment") gives a little preview of what they&#8217;ll talk about, I&#8217;ll withold any comments until I&#8217;ve had a chance to watch it.

> With no known cause or cure for autism yet, researchers are trying to detect the earliest signs of the disorder so they can begin treatment earlier, giving parents some hope against a condition the government now says affects about one in every 150 children.
> 
> 60 Minutes correspondent Lesley Stahl reports on ongoing research this Sunday, Feb. 18, at 7 p.m. ET/PT.
