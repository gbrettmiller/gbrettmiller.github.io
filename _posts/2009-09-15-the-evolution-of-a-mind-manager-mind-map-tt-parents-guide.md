To help me plan out the direction and content for the [Tramp and Tumble blog](http://trampandtumble.blogspot.com) over the next couple of months I created a mind map to collect and sort the various topics that I want to discuss there. One of the things that I love about [Mind Manager](http://www.mindjet.com/us/) is that it has such a nice looking, and useful, final product that hides all the effort that actually goes into creating the map. After all, the &#8220;customer&#8221; doesn&#8217;t really want to see the sausage being made, do they?

Those who are familiar with mind maps know, though, that creating a good map takes a lot of work; planning, mapping, evaluation, re-arranging, etc. In many ways, this is no different than the process for any good writing: ideas, sketch outline, draft, revise, update outline, update draft, revise, etc.  For those less familiar with the process for mind maps, I thought I&#8217;d give a little insight into how the process works for me, at least in this case.

[<img title="tnt-mind-map-notes" src="http://nostraightlines.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/tnt-mind-map-notes.jpg?w=670&#038;h=1024&#038;resize=210%2C323" alt="tnt-mind-map-notes" hspace="12" vspace="12" width="210" height="323" align="right" data-recalc-dims="1" />](http://nostraightlines.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/tnt-mind-map-notes.jpg)

I&#8217;ve been accumulating the knowledge that went into this map for several years now, since Ian first started competing in 2005. My first step was to create a list of questions that many parents new to the sport have as they start. __

_(Side note:  [Mind Manager](http://www.mindjet.com/us/) does include a &#8220;brainstorming&#8221; mode, but I have to admit that for things like this I still prefer to use something a bit more &#8220;analog&#8221;, in this case my handy-dandy notebook and a set of Sharpie pens.)_

The image to the right is a scan of my brainstorming list. I jotted down the main ideas, and sub-topics, as they occurred, going back later to mark them up with some ideas on what would make sense chronologically.

Having this list also gave me some ideas on how I could actually structure the topics in order to provide a somewhat consistent delivery of articles that make sense within a given time period; in this case, a week.

[<img title="tnt-mind-map-draft" src="http://nostraightlines.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/tnt-mind-map-draft.jpg?w=300&#038;h=252&#038;resize=193%2C162" alt="tnt-mind-map-draft" hspace="12" vspace="12" width="193" height="162" align="left" data-recalc-dims="1" />](http://nostraightlines.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/tnt-mind-map-draft.jpg)The next step was to convert these topics into a draft map. Again, Mind Manager provides excellent support for taking your brainstorming results and converting those into a draft map; again, I still prefer to do this part with good old pen and paper.

Pulling all of my topics and sub-topics together on this map further helped me find the ideas that should be kept together as part of a &#8220;weekly package&#8221;. The image on the left is (I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve figured out) my first draft.

From this draft I was able to easily create a map in Mind Manager, using the topics/subtopics in the draft as a guide. Once these were in Mind Manager, it was a simple matter to move the main ideas around to come up with the best organization and chronology. Here&#8217;s the final map, [as posted](http://trampandtumble.blogspot.com/2009/09/parents-guide-to-usag-jr-olympic-tramp.html) on the [Tramp and Tumble blog](http://trampandtumble.blogspot.com):

[<img class="alignnone" title="Parents guide mind map" src="https://i2.wp.com/lh3.ggpht.com/_C0gJ8DhqAGI/Sq2qNPwxcJI/AAAAAAAAAE0/eHGo8WhzN6Q/s800/Tramp%20and%20Tumble%20Parent%20Guide%20Map.gif?resize=468%2C287" alt="" width="468" height="287" data-recalc-dims="1" />](http://trampandtumble.blogspot.com/2009/09/parents-guide-to-usag-jr-olympic-tramp.html)

If you compare the two, you will see that there are many similarities but also some key differences. And just like any project, there are things from the initial idea that are not present and things in the final product that only showed up when the final draft was prepared.

Now all I have to do is fill in the details.
