&#8230;you can&#8217;t drag and drop text into the &#8220;Location&#8221; field in a [Microsoft Outlook](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/default.aspx "Outlook Home Page") appointment form? I know this is a small (some would say tiny) nit, but this is something that has bugged me for a while. I get most of my meeting invitations in e-mail, and most (these days) are a teleconference / web conference. To save a bit of time, I would like to be able to simply drag-and-drop the conference info. Seems reasonable, right? That&#8217;s what I thought.

I recently upgraded to [Vista](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsvista/editions/ultimate/default.mspx "Windows Vista Ultimate") (there&#8217;s a story in itself) and to Office 2007. I hoped (against hope, it seems) that I would finally be able to drag and drop text into the location field in Outlook appointments. As you&#8217;ve undoubtedly figured out by now, I was denied this simple pleasure. The thing is, this little thing wouldn&#8217;t bother me except for one thing: you can cut-and-paste into the field. (And, yes, I do have [drag-and-drop editing turned on](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/HA101732561033.aspx "Turn on or off drag-and-drop editing").)

So why can&#8217;t I drag-and-drop?
