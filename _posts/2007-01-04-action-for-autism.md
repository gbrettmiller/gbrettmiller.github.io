Mike? Hmm, that&#8217;s a new person leaving comments. Good comments. I wonder what his blog looks like. [Action For Autism](http://mikestanton.wordpress.com/), nice name. Wow, this is good stuff. He&#8217;s been blogging for how long, over a year? Over 27,000 hits? And he&#8217;s written some autism books? Have I been sleeping, or what?

That was my train of thought as I, well you can tell what I was doing.

It never ceases to amaze me that there is so much good stuff out there on autism, and I am continually frustrated that I&#8217;ll never be able to find it all (and even if I did I&#8217;d never get to read it all). 

If you&#8217;ve not seen Mike Stanton&#8217;s blog Action for Autism, do yourself a favor and check it out.
