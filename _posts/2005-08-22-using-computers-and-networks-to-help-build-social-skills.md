Zeke is an avid fan of computer and video games. Unlike the stereotypical kid and teenager, though, he has always preferred what you might call &#8220;educational&#8221; games. Reading, math, etc. The best of these, from this parent&#8217;s point of view, were the ones that also modeled good social interaction between characters. (The Sesame Street games were good, but I&#8217;m partial to the Reader Rabbit and Math Rabbit series. A more modern example is Animal Crossing on the Nintendo Game Cube.) 

It would not be an understatement to say that Zeke learned a lot of what he knows about social interaction from these games. (His brother learned how to read watching Zeke play the games and trying to keep up.) He hasn&#8217;t really used the internet much, but as he gets older I think he will.

And what a great tool for helping socially uncomfortable people (like autistic/Asperger&#8217;s kids) the internet can be. Check out this little bit from a story on [USATODAY.com](http://www.usatoday.com/life/lifestyle/2005-08-21-virtual-utopia_x.htm) : 

> Second Life serves just such a self-esteem boosting function for a group of residents with Asperger&#8217;s, a high-functioning form of autism that impairs social interaction.
> 
> A year ago, John Lester, director of information technology at Boston&#8217;s Massachusetts General Hospital, spent $1,000 to buy a private 16-acre island in Second Life that he dubbed Brigadoon.
> 
> As creator of the support site [braintalk.org](http://braintalk.org), Lester had seen the benefits of having patients interact via e-mail. The more realistic setting of Brigadoon has produced even greater breakthroughs.
> 
> &#8216;I see them making strong social connections that I&#8217;d never seen before,&#8217; Lester says. &#8216;When they&#8217;re ready, I&#8217;ve asked them to try and leave the island and visit the rest of Second Life.&#8217;
