The story of my life (courtesy [The Neo-Generalist](http://gbrettmiller.com/2016/10/26/the-neo-generalist/), p. 237):

> When you derive energy from the acquisition of knowledge and combinatory play, too much time spent doing the same thing can have an entropic effect. If your objective is to effect transformations, once that has been achieved it is the moment to move on to something different, passing the ball, handing over the jersey.

Maybe that&#8217;s how you know when it is time for the [next adventure](http://gbrettmiller.com/2016/10/20/the-next-adventure/).
