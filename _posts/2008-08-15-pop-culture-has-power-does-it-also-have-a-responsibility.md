In a previous post in which I discussed the [power of pop culture](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com/2007/02/the-power-of-pop-culture/), I wrote the following:

> As much as we may wish it were not so, we canâ€™t ignore the power of pop-culture and the influence it has had, and will continue to have, on the public perception of autism.

(You may have also seen a [version of this post earlier this year](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com/2008/01/the-power-of-pop-culture-redux/), when I reposted it in the wake of the ABC Eli Stone story. And, no, I&#8217;m going to repost the whole thing again ðŸ˜‰

In the article [Film comedy courts **controversy**; mental disabilities heart of issue](http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&ct=:ePkh8BM9E-LSYnMsLckszjXgFBLVEnQsLkgtSk8tUgiuzEspys9NBQqD7eXX4g7LTEnNV0hPzE0tBooqcDG7OQcDHacl4lZaUlqUquCcn5uUWALUWVySmmvABnG5lJaYkndefnlOakp6qoJvYl5iempual6JEsRgsK_K4R4Cey0D4jVuLfbcRKBRRZVAsyS0RFxTSpMTSzLz8xRKUpMz8vJz8tMrDThhnjcSuPc4NMwk9AuD_1ZNobI_2aoAiE47bg/2-0&fp=48a59db37bf7478c&ei=c5ilSJOLG4jO-AGP6ZT3DQ&url=http%3A//www.reporternews.com/news/2008/aug/14/comedy-courts-controversy-mental-disabilities-of/&cid=1237095243&sig2=yNO5Bq7KIkAyOvUpa_Vchg&usg=AFQjCNExRLFyBqTnYbTLZGE3McoNb_hT6A){#s-yNO5Bq7KIkAyOvUpa_Vchg:u-AFQjCNExRLFyBqTnYbTLZGE3McoNb_hT6A:r-2_1237095243}, Jenny Goode, chief executive officer of the [Betty Hardwick Center](http://bhcmhmr.org/), has the following to say about pop culture::

> &#8220;What we need to consider as responsible adults is that things that occur in pop culture, movies, television and books are things that people do use in some sort of layman&#8217;s way to educate themselves or to learn from or emulate in their own lives,&#8221; she said. &#8220;These things are repeated by young people and adults alike.&#8221;

These two quotes together brought to mind those immortal words of wisdom from Peter Parker&#8217;s Uncle Ben (yes, another somewhat gratuitous pop culture reference): &#8220;With great power comes great responsibility.&#8221;

Do the creators of pop culture &#8211; or any kind of &#8220;culture&#8221; &#8211; have a responsibility to wield their power responsibly?

Or is it our responsibility as consumers of pop culture to understand what it is that we are consuming and put it into the proper perspective for our own lives?
