Julie received a recall notice in the mail today for a piece of equipment she uses in her business. Actually, the recall was for a component part (a spring) of said equipment. Anyone who has owned a car or large appliance of some kind (got one on the dishwasher a couple of weeks ago) is familiar with the notices that come out. 

> Dear Valued Customer,

> We have identified a potential problem&#8230;. Our records show that you purchased&#8230;. To date, the problem has only occurred 5 times out of the 50,000+ that have been sold&#8230;. While the risk is low, we are replacing&#8230;..

Very straightforward for a purchase of hardware. (We know that it doesn&#8217;t happen for software, that&#8217;s what patches and updates are for.) 

What about management consulting engagements? What happens when the process you&#8217;ve helped a customer implement is shown to be &#8220;faulty,&#8221; and could actually hurt the company instead of help it? What if this happens a year or more after you&#8217;ve finished an engagement? Or is this more like an &#8220;upgrade,&#8221; something that should be treated as a follow up to something you&#8217;ve done in the past? 

I guess you could have minor version upgrades (KM v1.0 to KM v1.1) or major upgrades (KM v1.0 to KM v2.0). 

Just some rambling thoughts&#8230;.
