&#8220;The messiness of the web often deals with the messiness of disasters better than centralised systems which can fall over under pressure!&#8221; 

A Facebook friend posted this today, reminded me of these early thoughts I had back in the aftermath of Katrina along similar lines. But back then we didn&#8217;t have Twitter, we didn&#8217;t have Facebook and Instagram and &#8230; and &#8230; and&#8230;. 

And just now on the TV news feed: &#8220;People are resorting to Twitter and Facebook because the 911 system is overwhelmed.&#8221; Not just to connect with the centralized authorities, but to connect with &#8211; and help &#8211; each other.
