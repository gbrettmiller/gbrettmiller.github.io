Another example of the push and pull between individuals and the larger organization &#8211; which can also be seen as a question of decentralization vs. centralization &#8211; is discussed in [Organization in the Way: How decentralization hobbles the user experience](http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000351.php) by Peter Merholz and linked to by [Karl](http://www.karlnelson.net/weblog/000841.html) on his [Information Management Weblog](http://www.karlnelson.net/).
