My recent posts, and your comments to them, has got me thinking about the following question:

> **Aside from being a good parent, advocating for our autistic children when they are young, and helping them learn how to advocate for themselves as they get older, what are some things that parents can do advocate for autistics in general?**

I know what the basic message is, but what I&#8217;m not sure of is how best to get that message out; to friends, family, local media, educators, etc etc.

I&#8217;m going to be &#8220;off the grid&#8221; for the next 10 days, so I won&#8217;t respond to anything right away. But I&#8217;m looking forward to reading your ideas and suggestions.
