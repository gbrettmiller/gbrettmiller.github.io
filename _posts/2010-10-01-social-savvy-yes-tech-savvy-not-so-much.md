It is easy to look at &#8216;the younger generation&#8217; and think, &#8220;Wow, these kids really know computers and networking.&#8221; I used to think along the same lines. I mean, how could they use such cool tools and not want to know how they work, not take the time to figure out what makes them tick.

But when you talk to these kids, you quickly realize that most of them don&#8217;t have a clue about how it all works. I had this epiphany a few years ago when I was talking to a couple of teenagers about some piece of tech, probably video game tech, and realized that if something went wrong they would be out of luck.

Disc drive not working? No sound? Internet connection is down? Bummer, dude.

Bruce Schneier puts it very well in a recent discussion about privacy and the individual (which I found thanks to [@jmcgee](http://twitter.com/jmcgee) at [McGee&#8217;s Musings](http://www.mcgeesmusings.net/2010/09/13/bruce-schneiers-insights-on-tomorrows-privacy-environment/)):

> The younger generation is very fluent about how to use the internet, but completely clueless about how it works technically. Socially very savvy, technically very unsavvy.

Of course, this isn&#8217;t really anything new and I probably shouldn&#8217;t have been so surprised. Just looking back to my own teen years gives me all the insight I really need. Back then the main way to communicate was the telephone. I can count on one hand the other kids my age that knew &#8211; or cared &#8211; how the telephones worked; you should have seen the looks on their face when I tried to engage them in discussions about [DTMF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency) replacing [pulse-dialing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_dialing).

The reason the iPhone is so popular, and services like Facebook, Twitter, etc have so many users is because you don&#8217;t really have to understand how they work in order to use them. And that was fine when all you had was the telephone. But, as Schneier points out, today&#8217;s online social exchanges are different. All of our interactions on these digital services create an incredible amount of data; data about us, about our interests, and about our connections.

Understanding how the systems that own &#8211; and yes, they do **own** &#8211; this data about you work is critical. And not just for the kids, either.
