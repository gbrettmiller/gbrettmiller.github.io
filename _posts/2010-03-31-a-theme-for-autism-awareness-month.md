Every year when April &#8211; otherwise known as [Autism Awareness Month](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=autism+awareness+month+2010) &#8211; rolls around, I ask myself, &#8220;Awareness? Awareness of what exactly?&#8221; Most times I forget my own advice and try to find a &#8220;one-size-fits-all&#8221; answer to the question. (My advice: there is no such thing as one-size-fits-all for anything.) Some times I just bail on the question altogether.

This year I decided to try something different. Instead of trying to go &#8220;big picture&#8221; awareness, I&#8217;m going to focus on one aspect &#8211; a theme, if you will &#8211; of autism awareness. A consistent theme throughout all the various incarnations of this blog, not to mention my life as the parent of an autistic son, has always been that **<span style="color:#333399;">autistic people are just people like everyone else</span>**, with the same unique needs and desires as anyone else. It seems fitting that I use that as my theme.

Everyone is different, of course. The challenge with autism is that autistic kids and adults are different in a different way, a way that many people are not familiar with and &#8211; more importantly &#8211; not comfortable with.

So, for the next month I am going to revisit and repost some old articles and write a few new ones to build on this theme. I will also be looking around the web for others talking about the same theme. If I can make just one person more aware that <span style="color:#333399;"><strong>autistic people are just people like everyone else</strong></span>, I will consider my efforts a success.

Of course, I&#8217;m expecting to reach more people than that.
