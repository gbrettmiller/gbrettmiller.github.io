Sell out crowds. Overflow rooms. Young fans looking for autographs after a &#8216;performance.&#8217; Not things usually associated with a lecturer talking about prime numbers. But such was the case recently for [2006 Field&#8217;s Medal](http://www.mathunion.org/medals/2006/ "International Mathematical Union - 2006 Field's Medal") winner [Terence Tao](http://www.math.ucla.edu/~tao/ "Terence Tao's home page"). The article [Scientist at Work &#8211; Terence Tao &#8211; Journeys to the Distant Fields of Prime](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/13/science/13prof.html?pagewanted=2&ei=5087%0A&em&en=df354229c0e02e42&ex=1173931200) in the New York Times gives a profile of this young, talented mathematician, described as a &#8216;rock star&#8217; and the &#8216;Mozart of math.&#8217;

Though Tao is obviously quite gifted (an understatement), the description of his childhood, and how his parents handled his talent, is very telling as well. _[emphasis is mine]_

<blockquote cite="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/13/science/13prof.html?pagewanted=2&ei=5087%0A&em&en=df354229c0e02e42&ex=1173931200" title="NYT - Journeys to the Distant Fields of Prime">
  <p>
    [Terry&#8217;s father] Billy Tao knew the trajectories of child prodigies like Jay Luo, who graduated with a mathematics degree from Boise State University in 1982 at the age of 12, but who has since vanished from the world of mathematics.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    “I <strong>initially thought</strong> Terry would be just like one of them, to graduate as early as possible,” he said. But after talking to experts on education for gifted children, <strong>he changed his mind</strong>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    His parents decided <strong>not to push him</strong> into college full time, so he split his time between high school and Flinders University, the local university in Adelaide. He finally enrolled as a full-time college student at Flinders when he was 14, <strong>two years after he would have graduated </strong>had his parents pushed him only according to his academic abilities.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Taos had different challenges in raising their other two sons, although all three excelled in math. Trevor, two years younger than Terry, is autistic with top-level chess skills and the musical savant gift to play back on the piano a musical piece — even one played by an entire orchestra — after hearing it just once. He completed a Ph.D. in mathematics and now works for the Defense Science and Technology Organization in Australia.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The youngest, Nigel, told his father that he was “not another Terry,” and <strong>his parents let him learn at a less accelerated pace</strong>. Nigel, with degrees in economics, math and computer science, now works as a computer engineer for Google Australia.

But what really caught my eye was Billy Tao&#8217;s summary of how they approached their kids&#8217; learning:

<blockquote cite="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/13/science/13prof.html?pagewanted=2&ei=5087%0A&em&en=df354229c0e02e42&ex=1173931200" title="NYT - Journeys to the Distant Fields of Prime">
  <p>
    All along, we tend to emphasize the joy of learning. The fun is doing something, not winning something.
  </p>

Words to live by, indeed.
