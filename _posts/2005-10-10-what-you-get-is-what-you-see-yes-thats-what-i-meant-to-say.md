From Jakob Nielsen is [R.I.P. WYSIWYG &#8211; Results-Oriented UI Coming](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/wysiwyg.html), a look at the possible (and, he argues, needed) demise of the What You See is What You Get (WYSIWYG) design for user interface. 

> Unfortunately, we&#8217;ve now reached the limits of the current GUI paradigm. Displaying commands in menus, toolbars, and dialog boxes works with a limited number of elements. But Microsoft Word 2003 has 1,500 commands, and users typically have no clue where to find most of them.
> 
> Another WYSIWYG downside is that it forces too much manual labor on users and requires a stretch of imagination to envision results in advance. Yes, you can gradually massage your work into the shape you desire, one modification at a time, and visually confirm progress as you go. But you have to make each modification yourself, at the cost of many a mouse click&#8230;.
> 
> Direct manipulation of WYSIWYG objects thus has three primary limitations:
> 
>   * A plethora of commands, each of which you must locate (most people don&#8217;t, and thus never use most of the features they&#8217;ve paid for). 
>       * Lots of chopping away at the edges to shape your marble block of a blank screen into your desired goal (leading to a great loss of productivity). 
>           * No guidance relative to the goal; you must determine how to reach your goal from the starting state by combining multiple primitive commands. (This denies most users their expressive power; people are generally better at modifying an existing design than creating one from scratch.)</ul> </blockquote> 
>             Nielsen uses the new design in the [next version of Microsoft Office](http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/uioverview.mspx), based on a **results-oriented user interface**, to describe what he thinks this next generation of user interface will be like.
>             
>             Rest assured, the current GUI will stick around for quite a while, but &#8211; as Nielsen states &#8211; as Office goes, so goes much of the rest of the software world.
