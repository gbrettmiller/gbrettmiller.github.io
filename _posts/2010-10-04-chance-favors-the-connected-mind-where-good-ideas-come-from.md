I&#8217;ve read the [reviews](http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/2010/10/good-ideas-the-first-reviews.html), I&#8217;ve seen the [video](http://www.ted.com/talks/steven_johnson_where_good_ideas_come_from.html) (also embedded below), and I&#8217;ve listened in on [the webinar](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/good-ideas-from-steven-johnson/). And now that the UPS guy has made his afternoon delivery, I can finally read [Steven Johnson](http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com)&#8216;s ([@stevenbjohnson](http://twitter.com/stevenbjohnson)) latest book [Where Good Ideas Come From &#8211; The Natural History of Innovation](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594487715?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1594487715). (Though it is going to have to wait a day or two until I finish [The Mesh: Why the Future of Business Is Sharing](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591843715?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1591843715).)

Having read many of Johnson&#8217;s previous books, I know that I like his writing style and approach and fully expect to enjoy reading this book. More than anything, though, I&#8217;m looking forward to his **ideas on ideas**, especially the idea that **chance favors the connected mind**. If this isn&#8217;t enough to convince you that you should probably go out and get the book, please read on.

A couple of tidbits from reviews:

  * In &#8220;Where Good Ideas Come From: The Natural History of Innovation,&#8221; Steven Johnson, an author and Internet entrepreneur, draws on natural science, intellectual history and 21st-century technology to identify the environments that are conductive to innovation. Johnson doesn&#8217;t define &#8220;good ideas&#8221; &#8212; or indicate whether their pathways to implementation differ from those of &#8220;bad ideas.&#8221;  &#8211; [The Oregonian](http://www.oregonlive.com/books/index.ssf/2010/10/nonfiction_review_where_good_i.html)
  * Where do good ideas come from? That is the question posed by Steven Johnson, a writer known for the agility with which he makes interdisciplinary analogies, in his latest book. His “natural history of innovation” provides a taxonomy of seven ways in which new ideas can sprout from old ones. But this is no management text: for each of his seven patterns of innovation, Mr Johnson provides wide-ranging examples from technology, the natural world and culture. &#8211; [The Economist](http://www.economist.com/node/17145208?story_id=17145208&fsrc=rss)

Luis Suarez ([@elsua](http://twitter.com/elsua)) has some [excellent thoughts on Johnson&#8217;s TED talk](http://www.elsua.net/2010/10/01/the-liquid-network-where-good-ideas-come-from/) on the subject, along with this ringing endorsement:

> Do you happen to have about 18 minutes of your precious busy time &#8230; to spare to go ahead and watch one of those [TED Talks](http://www.ted.com/talks) that will surely keep you thinking for a while on what _true_ innovation is all about? You do? Then you have got to go and watch [Steven](http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/) [Johnson](http://twitter.com/#!/stevenbjohnson)‘s Talk on [Where Good Ideas Come From](http://www.ted.com/talks/steven_johnson_where_good_ideas_come_from.html). It’s worth the 18 minutes and _so much more!_

Johnson is [currently touring for the book](http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/2010/09/tour-dates-for-where-good-ideas-come-from.html), and will be in St. Louis on 14 October. (I must now make a choice: stick around at the [Strange Loop Conference](http://www.strangeloop2010.com) for the[Strange Passions party](http://http://strangeloop2010.com/pages/strange_passions) or duck out to see Johnson. Decisions, decisions.)
