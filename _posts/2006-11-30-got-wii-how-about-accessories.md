Though not as rare in the wild as Sony&#8217;s [PlayStation 3](http://www.us.playstation.com/PS3 "PlayStation.com - PlayStation(r) 3"), the [Nintendo Wii](http://wii.nintendo.com/ "Nintendo Wii") is still a [good catch](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/2006/bringing-gaming-back-to-the-masses-nintendo-wii "Bringing gaming back to the masses - Nintendo Wii"). After waiting in line to get my own Wii on the launch date (actually I waited in line to get one as a Christmas gift for the boys), I&#8217;m anxious to hook it up and start playing. Since this is a gift for the boys, though, I find myself in Jason&#8217;s situation (just replace Jason with me in the FoxTrot strip shown here and you get the idea!)

News")

Fortunately, though, we have had a chance to try out the Wii at the [local mall](http://westfield.com/westcounty/ "Westfield West County Directory"), both at the [EB Games](http://www.ebgames.com/gs/wii/wii_tour.asp "EBgames.com - Nintendo Wii Tour") there and a [Nintendo kiosk](http://www.nintendo.com/eventdetail?eventid=5uJA209n2wgNKaqlB1yeK0MaSHWnJMY8 "Nintendo.com Events: Wii Mall Experience") with several Wii _(what is the plural of Wii, anyway)_ set up. We tried our hand at [Excite Truck](http://www.nintendo.com/gamemini?gameid=X-Ip9O46zi1OyeMxBFyfdI_XDV06v7Ne "Nintendo.com Games: Excite Truck") and [Wii Sports](http://www.nintendo.com/gamemini?gameid=1OTtO06SP7M52gi5m8pD6CnahbW8CzxE "Nintendo.com Games: Wii Sports"), both of which give a chance to appreciate the great motion sensitive controllers (my favorite was the golf game in Wii Sports).

If you are a parent who has picked up a Wii for you kids (or even if you picked it up for yourself), you should check out this set of &#8220;[must have Wii accessories](http://news.com.com/2300-1043_3-6139463.html?tag=ne.gall.latest "Photos: Eight must-have Wii accessories | CNET news.com")&#8221; from C/Net. If you have any other suggestions for must-have accessories or games, please let me know. I want to make sure I&#8217;m all set when I &#8211; er, I mean we &#8211; finally open it up and hook it up.

Waa!
