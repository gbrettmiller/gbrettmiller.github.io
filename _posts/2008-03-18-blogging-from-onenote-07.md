Unfortunately, many of these ideas have never made it off of paper. If only there were an easy way to post from my quickly written out ideas….

One of the things that caught my eye when going through the things [OneNote 2007](http://www.windows.com/onenote) can do was the **Blog This** option when you **right-click** a page. This page is meant to be a test of that functionality.

Because of the way OneNote handles text and images &#8211; basically, put it wherever you want it on the page, I&#8217;m curious how it will handle the different placement of elements when it converts to HTML. This paragraph that I&#8217;m currently writing is a separate element from the text above, placed below and a bit offset from the rest of the text. I captured the graphic using the **windows+S** key combination and dropped it in on the right side of the page.

_Update from within Word 2007:  
_ 

Once I clicked on **Blog This,** OneNote sent the page into Word &#8217;07. I kind of expected this based on my [previous experience with Word &#8217;07 and blogging](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/2008/test-from-word-2007), but I was hoping that OneNote would simply use the account settings from Word. As you can see (well, I can see it since I know what the original looked like), Word has taken the free-flowing format of a OneNote page and converted it into a more structured document. The only change I made to the page (except for adding this description) was to adjust the text wrapping properties and location of the image.

From here the process is somewhat familiar, but I&#8217;m still going to have to do some tweaking once I get it up into WordPress. For example, you can **Insert Category** from within Word, but you can only select one category – **Ctrl-click** doesn&#8217;t work.

_Update from within WordPress_:

Once I got into WordPress, everything in the post looked fine. I added the categories I wanted this post filed under and it was ready to post.

A quick recap of the process:

  1. Put together a rough (or not so rough) draft in OneNote.
  2. When ready, **right-click** on the **Blog This** option
  3. In Word 2007, adjust the flow of the text and images as needed, then **Publish as Draft**.
  4. In WordPress, open the draft, modify the post properties (Categories, tags, timestamp, etc). Then **Publish**.

Which is what I&#8217;m going to do now.
