Three and a half years and nearly 250 posts.  That&#8217;s the life so far of 29 Marbles. And to tell the truth, I&#8217;ve run out of new things to write about.  Not that there isn&#8217;t always something happening in the world related to autism, but like everything else it all seems to happen in cycles.  Different day/month/year, the same stories and questions in different clothing.   

Nowhere is this more evident than in the referral logs for the site.  Most hits come either from the [Autism Hub](http://www.autism-hub.co.uk), or from search results.  Sometimes the search queries are on things I wrote about years ago, sometimes more recent.  But inevitably, the same questions keep coming back around.

I first started writing this blog to help me sort through my own feelings and thoughts on autism.  That goal is accomplished; I have a much better conscious understanding now than I did three and a half years ago. But there are many others out there still forming the questions in their minds and looking for answers.   Among those nearly 250 posts are what I feel are good responses to some of those questions.  

I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll continue to write the occasional &#8220;new&#8221; post, but for now I&#8217;m going to dig into the archives and bring out those that answer the questions I see in my referral logs.   Who knows, I might even have something new to add to those things I haven&#8217;t given much thought to in a while.
