A couple of weeks ago, I saw [Matt Homann&#8217;s post](http://thenonbillablehour.typepad.com/nonbillable_hour/2006/08/things_i_like.html "the [non]billable hour - Things I Like") about his new [Amazon aStore](http://astore.amazon.com/thenonbillaho-20 "Matthew Homann Recommends"). I&#8217;ve been an [Amazon Associate](http://affiliate-program.amazon.com/join/103-1330264-8183869?%5Fencoding=UTF8&tag=demostore-20&linkCode=sb1 "Amazon.com Associates") for a year or so, but I don&#8217;t rely on it for anything so haven&#8217;t really been paying attention to what they&#8217;ve been doing. When I logged in to the affiliate site, there was a very quick explanation of the aStore and a four-step wizard to get set up. So, I set one up.

It&#8217;s a nice set-up, still in early stages and beta so it obviously has room to improve. In fact, since I first set up my aStore, Amazon has added the ability to add additional pages beyond the standard &#8220;Featured Products&#8221; home page of an aStore.

There are two ways you can have people visit your aStore: you can give them a link to the aStore itself (for example, [Brett Miller&#8217;s Shop](http://astore.amazon.com/gbrettmiller-20 "Amazon aStore - Brett Miller's Shop")); or you can embed the aStore on a page inside your site (for example, [My Amazon aStore](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/my-amazon-astore/ "No Straight Lines - My Amazon aStore")). I prefer the latter, since it keeps everything within the site, but I&#8217;ve not been able to figure out how to &#8216;deep link&#8217; into individual items within my page set up. My [last post](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/2006/royal-society-archives "No Straight Lines - Complete archives of Royal Society available free through December") included deep links to items, but these went to the Amazon hosted aStore. I&#8217;d also like to see an RSS feed for the Featured Items page so people could subscribe to keep up with what has changed.

A lot of my posts draw their inspiration from various media &#8211; including books, CDs, DVDs, and video games &#8211; all things you can find on Amazon. Though I don&#8217;t expect to make a whole lot of money through this, it seems silly to not take advantage of the system when I&#8217;m referring to it so much anyway. So, if you think you want to buy a book from Amazon based on what you read here, please feel free. (And tell all your friends, too ðŸ˜‰ )
