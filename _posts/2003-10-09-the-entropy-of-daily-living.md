When did people stop taking shopping carts back? When did they stop driving in the right lane except to pass? More importantly, **WHY** did they stop? As the title of this post implies, I think it is simple [entropy](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=entropy). 

Here&#8217;s my reasoning:  


  * In the beginning of any man-made system there is, almost by definition, order imposed on the system.  
    </p> 
      * At first, this order remains intact, much as if their is an external force keeping things together.  
        </p> 
          * As the system becomes commonplace and grows, there is not enough energy in the system to keep it orderly.  
            </p> 
              * The system degenerates into, effectively, chaos. You have some pockets of order, but for the most part you have a system at equilibrium, where each piece just does its own thing.  
                </ul> 
                Very simplistic, but makes sense (to me). The same type of reasoning can be applied to just about any social system (and I&#8217;m sure someone somewhere has done that before I ever thought of this), especially in the corporate environment. In your change management planning, don&#8217;t forget to consider the inevitable effects of entropy.
