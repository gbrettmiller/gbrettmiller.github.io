As much as I use, and enjoy using, information technologies, my primary personal note taking (and storing, for that matter) media is a paper notebook. My current book of choice is the **[Infinity Journal](http://www.levenger.com/PAGETEMPLATES/PRODUCT/Product.asp?Params=Category=322-325%7CPageID=176%7CLevel=2-3)** from [Levenger](http://www.levenger.com/). With 600 pages, I get about a year out of each book. Everything goes into this book, including random thougths throughout the day, notes from meetings, and quotes/passages from books/websites, etc. At times I even print-and-paste things from my computer into the notebook so I have it available whenever I may need it.

Of course, paper does have some limitations. Two key ones are searchability and organization. To solve the searchability problem for key things such as phone numbers, e-mail addresses, web sites, etc. that tend to get jotted down in haste, I use a [Moleskine pocket-size address book](http://www.moleskine.com/eng/_interni/catalogo/Cat_int/catalogo_pocket.htm). Though it is called an address book, it is really just a notebook with the letters of the alphabet on tabs every few pages. No &#8220;rules&#8221; on what should go in, just a simple way to organize. (I&#8217;ve chosen to alphabetize names by first name, since that is what I usually think of when I want to call someone.)

As for the organization part, that&#8217;s not so easy. I do use a paper calendar to keep basic schedule stuff (see my response to Jack&#8217;s post [Thinking While Note Taking](http://www.jackvinson.com/archives/2005/02/02/thinking_while_note_taking.html) for more on that), but that doesn&#8217;t help with organizing the notes I have. I do number the pages, as well as date them when I jot something down, so that helps a bit.

I have tried several digital methods of note taking/keeping, but I&#8217;ve yet to find one that works for me. My first try was with a &#8220;digital pad&#8221; from Cross (the pen people) many years ago. This was (is?) basically a base-station for a paper pad that captures your writing, which can then be transferred to a computer. Very clunky, maybe ahead of its time. Next was a Palm OS based Handspring handheld. I&#8217;ve also tried a couple of different systems that tried to tie a pen-and-paper notepad into the Handspring, but they didn&#8217;t work either. The one thing I haven&#8217;t yet tried is a Windows Tablet PC. If they work near as well as they are supposed to, they may work out. But then again, I&#8217;m a Mac guy so&#8230;.

Speaking of the Mac, I&#8217;ve just started trying out a new tool to organize my notes: [DEVONthink](http://devon-technologies.com/products/devonthink/overview.php) from [DEVON Technologies](http://devon-technologies.com/). I first heard of this on [Steve Johnson&#8217;s blog](http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/movabletype/archives/000230.html) and figured I should give it a try. Still in the early stages of figuring out exactly how best to use it, but it definitely has potential. I think I will keep to pen-and-ink (nothing like the feel of a good fountain pen) for day to day stuff, but this may be what I&#8217;ve been looking for to help me find what I need when I need it.
