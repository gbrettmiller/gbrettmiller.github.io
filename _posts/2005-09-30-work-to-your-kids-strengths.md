I found this bit of wisdom in the book [<span style="font-weight:bold;">Never Eat Alone</span>](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/0385512058&link_code=as2&camp=1789&tag=gbrettmiller-20&creative=9325) by Keith Ferrazzi. Though geared at self improvement, this quote struck a chord with me as a parent: 

> The trick is not to work obsessively on the skills and talents you lack, but to focus and cultivate your strengths so that your weaknesses matter less.

The [story of Tony DeBlois](http://29marbles.blogspot.com/2005/09/genius-comes-in-many-forms-review-of.html) is an example of this in action. His mother recognized that Tony had serious weaknesses/disabilities to overcome, but also realized that his strength in music could make much of that weakness irrelevant.

I think all of our kids have their own strengths. Much of it may be hidden from us as parents*, or their strength may be something that we don&#8217;t quite understand or appreciate as worth cultivating. 

But it is by cultivating these strengths, in **all** of our kids (and ourselves), that we can help them be successful in whatever they ultimately decide to do. 

&#8211; &#8211; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212;&#8211;  
_* Ferrazzi also gives this observation from Machiavelli: &#8220;Everyone sees what you appear to be, few really know what you are.&#8221;_
