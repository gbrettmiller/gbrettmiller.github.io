I had lunch with an old friend recently, and the topic of conversation wound its way to autism. I, of course, am the parent of an autistic son. As it turns out, his nephew is also autistic. He wanted to understand autism, and I wanted to help him understand. But I didn&#8217;t know where to start.

Sure, there are many angles from which to approach the question. I could start with: <span style="font-style:italic;">Vaccines cause autism, once they have it, it&#8217;s a long struggle to recover them.</span> Or how about: <span style="font-style:italic;">Nothing &#8220;causes&#8221; autism, it is just another aspect of this neurodiverse world we live in.</span>

As far as treatment: <span style="font-style:italic;">Chelation, to get rid of the mercury and other metals.</span> Or: <span style="font-style:italic;">A special diet that is almost impossible, and incredibly expensive, to adhere to.</span> Or: _ABA_. Or: _(add your favorite treatment here)._

To tell the truth, I don&#8217;t know what to believe about autism. And it is not for a lack of trying. This post, according to my WordPress stats, is my 201st posting to 29 Marbles. I have covered a lot of autistic ground in the last 3 years. Over the course of those 3 years, and 200 posts, and numerous comments to other blogs by parents, autistics, and others with an interest in autism, I&#8217;ve considered a lot of different ideas and seen my beliefs and thoughts about autism oscillate a bit as I considered new things. I always seem to [come back to the middle](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com/2008/01/the-ideology-and-partisanship-of-autism/) though, where I don&#8217;t really know what to think.

Over this time, I&#8217;ve also had the opportunity to observe how the views of others have evolved. In most cases, it seems, the longer someone has been blogging and thinking about autism the more their beliefs, and their blogging, have gone toward the extremes of the debate. Just check out [Age of Autism](http://www.ageofautism.com "Age of Autism") (for the extreme view of the bio-med position) or [Neurodiversity.com](http://www.neurodiversity.com "Neurodiversity.com") (for the extreme view of neurodiversity).

The thing is, I don&#8217;t really believe any of those things. Or, maybe it would be more accurate to say I believe in all of those things. Autism is, after all, a spectrum of disorders, so it only makes sense that the causes and cures (assuming either exist) would constitute a spectrum as well.

For someone to say that all autism is nothing more than mercury poisoning is irresponsible, though I don&#8217;t doubt that at least one case of autism could be traced directly to mercury. To say that all autistics live miserable lives and will never be happy or able to live and function on their own is simply untrue, though it goes without saying that there are some autistics whose life will be exactly like that.

On the other hand, to say that all autism is solely the result of genetic factors &#8211; with no influence from environmental triggers &#8211; is irresponsible, though I sincerely believe that some cases of what we call autism are indeed purely genetic manifestations. To say that all autistics have the potential to live happy lives and live and function on their own is as untrue as the opposite example above, though obviously some autistics will find happiness and success on their own.

Some will say I&#8217;m just wishy-washy, a waffler, a flip-flopper. I prefer to think that I&#8217;m simply staying open minded, because when you get right down to it not all the evidence is in. Not even enough evidence is in to say anything specific about autism in general.

And that, I think, is my point on this, World Autism Awareness Day. If you are new to autism, because you have a newly diagnosed child or you are just curious, enjoy the view from the middle for a while. Listen to what the extremists and <a title="strict adherence to any set of basic ideas or principles: the fundamentalism of the extreme conservatives.">fundamentalists</a> have to say and think about it for yourself. Pay attention to your own instincts. Get to know your child &#8211; as he or she is, not how you wish they were &#8211; and figure out what YOU think is best. Not just for the child, but for you. For your spouse. For your other children.

There is no simple answer, no matter what you hear, and there is no simple path to follow as you make your way through the world of autism.
