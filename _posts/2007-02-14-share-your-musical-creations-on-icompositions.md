Like many others, I have been making use of [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com) and [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com) to post pictures and video. In fact, part of my recent new layout of this site was to allow me to post links to those sites. Over the Christmas break, I discovered a new site to share my digital music creations: [iCompositions](http://www.icompositions.com "iCompositions.com - Empowering the Independent Musician").

So far, I&#8217;ve posted 4 songs, which you can listen to from my artist page. One was done in [Apple](http://www.apple.com "Apple")&#8216;s [Soundtrack](http://www.apple.com/finalcutexpress/soundtrack.html "Apple - Final Cut Express HD - Soundtrack") application (which came with [Final Cut Express](http://www.apple.com/finalcutexpress/ "Apple - Final Cut Express HD")), the others in [GarageBand](http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/ "Apple - iLife - GarageBand") (part of the Apple [iLife](http://www.apple.com/ilife "Apple - iLife") suite of apps), all exclusively using Apple Loops &#8211; I&#8217;ve not quite made it to the point of recording any original material.

Most of the songs I&#8217;ve put together have been in the context of video scores. I&#8217;m working my way up to songs I think can stand on their own. Like many of the social sharing sites, iCompositions has a large community of people who are more than happy to help you as you learn and to provide comments and criticism that will help you improve.

iCompositions is also a great place to find new music from a large collection of independent musicians in a wide variety of genres. Something for everyone&#8217;s taste. Quite a few of the songs I&#8217;ve found there have made their way onto my iPod (like [makpiano88](http://www.icompositions.com/artists/makpiano88)&#8216;s [Awakening](http://www.icompositions.com/artists/makpiano88 "Awakening by makpiano88 | iCompositions")).
