What I really wanted to say (shout, really) was, &#8220;Please make it stop!&#8221; I am referring, of course, to the (seemingly) never-ending supply of new tools and applications that allow me to create, connect, comment, collaborate, etc etc.

Several years ago (not that many, really), I wrote a paper for an organization addressing the evolution of corporate communications from the interdepartmental memo, to e-mail, and the emergence of instant messaging, with a bit of voice mail thrown in. I was trying to help managers, who had always had a secretary to take dictation or decipher their hand-written notes, figure out how to use these new tools themselves. (They had no choice, as secretaries were slowly removed from the workforce.)

I can only imagine what that paper would look like if I tried to write it today. In addition to e-mail and IM, now we&#8217;ve got blogs and wikis, intranets and portals, social networking apps, and cell phones with text messaging, photo messaging, video messaging. Assuming an organization had a coherent information architecture and strategy, you would still be hard pressed to be able to explain all this to someone who didn&#8217;t just &#8220;get it.&#8221;

I have to admit that I kind of fall into that latter category. I&#8217;ve been messing around with blogs (with varying success) for over 5 years now, have set up and contributed to my fair share of other online sources like wikis and as a commenter to other blogs. But I&#8217;ve only recently really understood the value and, yes, appeal of text messaging and the ability to send photos and videos from anywhere on my phone. And, though I&#8217;ve recently signed up and started experimenting with [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com "Facebook"), I&#8217;m still not quite sure exactly what to do with it. And don&#8217;t get me started with things like [Twitter](http://twitter.com/ "Twitter.com") &#8211; as much as friends and others praise it, I just don&#8217;t get it.

One of the key questions I&#8217;m still not sure how to answer is: with all of these means of communications available with my friends, colleagues, and strangers that I&#8217;d like to get to know, what is the best way to actually communicate &#8211; E-mail? Facebook? Post a comment on their blog? Post to my blog about their blog? Update Twitter?

As if that isn&#8217;t enough, a [recent post](http://blog.jackvinson.com/archives/2007/07/31/the_elusive_me_collector.html "The elusive Me collector") by [Jack Vinson](http://www.jackvinson.com "Jack Vinson") &#8211; commenting on a [post by Amy Gahran](http://www.contentious.com/archives/2007/07/30/i-want-one-place-for-all-my-content-pipe-dream/ "I want one place for all my content: Pipe Dream?") &#8211; now has me thinking of another issue raised by all this: How do I keep track of it all? Fortunately for me, Jack provides some possible solutions to explore as I try to answer that question.

All of this is why I ask for a time out, to try to sort it all out and figure out what to do with it all. _(Just kidding, of course, I really do love this stuff!)_
