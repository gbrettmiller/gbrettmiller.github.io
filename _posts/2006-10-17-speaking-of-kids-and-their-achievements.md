One of my hobbies / interests is video production, though production may be too strong a word. Basically, I&#8217;m trying to put together the Miller family story using years and years of home video. As the kids have gotten older, I&#8217;ve also been documenting their various activities and achievements. iMovie has been my editor of choice (though with the help of the folks at Apple ProCare, I&#8217;m learning Final Cut Express), and I&#8217;ve been [using GarageBand](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/2006/tools-do-not-a-master-make "Tools do not a master make") to put together some musical accompaniment.

I&#8217;ve also been playing around with YouTube of late as a way to share movies with friends and family without having to send them a DVD. My first test is a [video of highlights](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsPkXA2j7iw "YouTube - St. Louis Elite at the MO State Tramp and Tumble Championships") of [St. Louis Elite Tramp and Tumble](http://www.gatewaykidsworld.com/team.html "St. Louis Elite Tramp and Tumble at Gateway Kids World") from the 2006 Missouri State Trampoline and Tumbling Championships. (You may remember that [last summer I wrote](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/2006/mastery-at-work-trampoline-and-tumbling "Mastery at work:  Trampoline and Tumbling") about the 2006 Junior Olympic National Championships in Chicago and my son Ian&#8217;s performance there. I haven&#8217;t quite gotten around to compiling that video yet.) This is a very basic edit, with a minimum of transitions and effects. I &#8216;composed&#8217; the [music that goes with it](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/Piano%20Jam.mp3 "Brett Miller - Piano Jam (mp3)") in GarageBand.

YouTube is extremely easy to figure out and use. My problem has been trying to find the right (best?) export settings from iMovie. As you&#8217;ll see on the video I&#8217;ve posted, the resolution is not very good. If I try to go higher on the resolution, though, the frame rate gets very choppy, almost unusable. Any suggestions are appreciated.

_update: For those of you who are interested, I&#8217;ve uploaded the [mp3 for the music in the video](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/Piano%20Jam.mp3 "Brett Miller - Piano Jam (mp3)")._
