In his book **Everything Bad is Good for You**, Steven Johnson (who blogs at [stevenberlinjohnson.com](http://stevenberlinjohnson.com "Steven Johnson's Blog")) puts forth the argument that Pop Culture &#8211; especially video games &#8211; contributes to the intelligence and mental agility of today&#8217;s youth.

<blockquote title="amazon.com - Everything Bad is Good for You" cite="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594481946/sr=1-1/qid=1154644404/ref=sr_1_1/002-0054287-6120840?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books">
  <p>
    In his fourth book, <em>Everything Bad Is Good for You</em>, iconoclastic science writer Steven Johnson &#8230; takes on one of the most widely held preconceptions of the postmodern world&#8211;the belief that video games, television shows, and other forms of popular entertainment are detrimental to Americans&#8217; cognitive and moral development.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The heart of Johnson&#8217;s argument is something called the Sleeper Curve&#8211;a universe of popular entertainment that trends, intellectually speaking, ever upward, so that today&#8217;s pop-culture consumer has to do more &#8220;cognitive work&#8221;&#8211;making snap decisions and coming up with long-term strategies in role-playing video games, for example, or mastering new virtual environments on the Internet&#8211; than ever before.

Texas teenager Brad Coleman would make a very good &#8220;poster-child&#8221; for this argument: his childhood experience with [NASCAR racing games](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_vg/002-0054287-6120840?url=search-alias%3Dvideogames&field-keywords=NASCAR&Go.x=0&Go.y=0&Go=Go "amazon.com - NASCAR Video and Computer Games") led him to his first [NASCAR](http://www.nascar.com/ "NASCAR.com") race only two weeks out of high school.

    Games offered the only exposure Coleman had to racing growing up in Houston. His father owned a marketing company, and his grandfather, Don, was a Hall of Fame high school basketball coach.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Sure, he impressed babysitters as a toddler racing a battery-powered car at the mall, and his parents thought he might be a racer when he fell asleep at the age of 4 in his battery-powered Jeep with his foot pressed on the accelerator &#8212; and kept turning circles in the driveway.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    But talented enough to go from his first go-kart race to his Busch debut in the span of five years? Yes, and part of the credit goes to Coleman&#8217;s natural ability honed by <em>years of pretending to be doing his homework when he actually was racing cars on his Sega Genesis, then PlayStation, his computer and then Xbox.</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8220;It all started out on the NASCAR video games,&#8221; Coleman said. &#8220;When I was a little kid, I knew all the NASCAR tracks like the back of my hand. That helps me now.&#8221;

Obviously this path to mastery doesn&#8217;t work in all professions, or for all individuals. But it is an example of how the right tools, along with some innate talent and a drive for success, can help you learn. Even if that tool is &#8216;something bad for you.&#8217;
