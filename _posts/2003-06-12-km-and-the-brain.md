When we talk about brains, we talk about **neuroscience** as dealing with the _technology_ and **psychology/psychiatry** as dealing with the _processes_ of the brain. 

Many KM practitioners recognize, indeed advocate, the distinction of two perspectives on KM: **Object** and **Process**. Together they make up a **System** perspective. You can&#8217;t really look at one without the other. You can&#8217;t really **_function_** without both.

As I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve deduced, I&#8217;m leading to an analogy:  


> <font>Neuroscience Object / Technology Perspective<br /> <br />Psych Process Perspective</font>

In other words, **KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT IS THE NEUROSCIENCE AND PSYCHOLOGY/PSYCHIATRY OF AN ORGANIZATION**.
