Paper Prototyping: How-To Training Video from Nielsen Norman Group.](http://www.ciadvertising.org/studies/student/98_fall/theory/hornor/paper1.html) 

I&#8217;ve not seen the DVD, but I&#8217;m sure it lives up to the high standards .NN/g adheres to on everything else they do. Basically, it shows techniques for, as the title states, Paper Prototyping. 

I can&#8217;t attest to the techniques they espouse, but the basic concept is, it seems to me, common sense and I&#8217;ve used it for quite a few things. Even if you are just using it for yourself as a way to figure out how to do something, it is a worthwhile technique. 

And I&#8217;m sure this DVD is well worth the $50 (+ $3 s&h).
