I just finished reading Superposition by David Walton. From the structure of the book, with chapters alternating points of view from one version of the protagonist to another, to the ultimate reason that evil (?) is unleashed upon the world, Superposition keeps you thinking and guessing what is coming next. Like any story, there comes a point where you are pretty sure you know what is going to ultimately happen; David Walton does a very good job of putting this point as near to the end of the book as possible. A bit of violence, a lot of discussion about quantum entanglement and the nature of consciousness and free will. I&#8217;m looking forward to reading the sequel, Supersymmetry.
