How we describe things, how we label them, makes all the difference in how what we are trying to describe is perceived.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes how we label and describe things we are in favor of is meant to portray opposing views in a negative light (just look at the terms used in the abortion debate: pro-choice vs. pro-life).&nbsp;&nbsp;

Have you ever heard of [dihydrogen monoxide](http://www.dhmo.org/)?&nbsp;&nbsp;Should you have?&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are some facts:

  * Dihydrogen monoxide is colorless, odorless, tasteless, and kills uncounted thousands of people every year. 


  * Most of these deaths are caused by accidental inhalation of DHMO


  * Prolonged exposure to its solid form causes severe tissue damage. 


  * Symptoms of DHMO ingestion can include excessive sweating and urination, and possibly a bloated feeling, nausea, vomiting and body electrolyte imbalance. 


  * For those who have become dependent, DHMO withdrawal means certain death.

What is this horrible, lethal substance?&nbsp;&nbsp;Why hasn’t it been banned by the government?&nbsp;&nbsp;If you remember your high school chemistry, you have already figured out that dihydrogen monoxide is nothing more than plain old H2O – water.&nbsp;&nbsp;But spin it the right way, and it is B-A-D bad.

What is your initial reaction when you read these symptoms?

  * Lack of abilility to spend time in the company of oneself for a long duration


  * Preoccupation with being with others, especially in social events


  * Preoccupation with oneself, one&#8217;s career, one&#8217;s material and physical image


  * Preoccupation with one&#8217;s social status, fame and income

Or this description of life from someone who ‘suffers’ from this syndrome:

  * I do too many things and don&#8217;t really focus on one. Instead of just focussing on one thing at a time, like I would like to do, I try to do too many things and it seems like I&#8217;ve got it all figured out, but I really don&#8217;t. &#8220;Inability to focus intensively on one interest,&#8221; is a definite symptom.


  * Judgement. I judge everyone. I judge based on whether you are like me or not like me. I expect everyone to blend together, to homogenize. If there is any difference, I become afraid and have to send that different person away. &#8220;Persistent intolerance of others,&#8221; is another symptom.


  * I am highly impatient. I guess that&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t really think that hard about anything. It takes up too much time when I have to get my hair done. Not to mention impatient with others. I don&#8217;t have time to listen to your bla bla!


  * I take things for granted. Um hum. Big time. I don&#8217;t take time to &#8220;smell the flowers&#8221; or watch the rain fall&#8230; Who has time? I need to stand in line at Starbucks while I&#8217;m rushing to get to work!


  * It says in this manual I read today, that &#8221; there is also a strong fascination for social belonging to the point of chronic lying&#8230;In most cases, there is an associated diagnosis of depression, substance-related disorders, sedative dependence, and other behavioural symptoms including inability to listen carefully to others, difficulty with empathy, and a deep fear of heterogeneity.&#8221;

Sound like anyone you know?&nbsp;&nbsp;You, maybe?&nbsp;&nbsp;The symptoms are, in fact, of “Neurotypical Syndrome” as identified by [Estee](http://joyofautism.blogspot.com/) in a [thought-provoking post of the same name](http://joyofautism.blogspot.com/2006/01/dancing.html). 

In the same way I believe that the words we use to describe autistics are unnecessarily negative.&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there negative aspects to autism and Asperger’s?&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolutely.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that all there is to people diagnosed as such?&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolutely not.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I’ve been told many times through the years that perception is reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you perceive a thing negatively, it will have a negative influence on your life, on your reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we perceive autism in our children as only a negative, a bad thing, then that is how it will play out in our lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;

If, on the other hand, we can see the positives – of course while acknowledging the negatives – the impact on our lives will be correspondingly positive.&nbsp;&nbsp;
