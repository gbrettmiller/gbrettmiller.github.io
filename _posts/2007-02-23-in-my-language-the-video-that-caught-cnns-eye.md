The spark that caught CNN&#8217;s eye about Amanda Baggs (see my [last post](http://29marbles.blogspot.com/2007/02/why-dont-more-people-understand-this.html#links) if you don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about) was her video &#8220;In My Language&#8221; posted on YouTube. While it is easy enough to just [go to YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnylM1hI2jc) to watch it, I would like to share it here as well.
