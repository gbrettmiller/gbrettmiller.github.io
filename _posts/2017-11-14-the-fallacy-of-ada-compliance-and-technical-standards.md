    Alright folks, first, I’d like to address the term “ADA Compliant." Last year, the Department of Justice withdrew plans for implementing technical accessibility requirements to the web sites of public entities under Title II of ADA, citing the need for more information on the appropriateness of setting requirements for small public entities, the costs and benefits of web accessibility, and additional measures.
    <blockquote>"When it comes to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the dirty secret is that there are no specific technical requirements for any website. There are no standards which apply to the ADA and unless you’re a State or Local Government, there is no specific reference to website accessibility."

    Consequently, a digital product cannot be labeled as “ADA compliant," because there is no technical standard that applies. Among the number of laws in the United States that prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability, the <em>only</em> accessibility-specific technical requirements can be found in Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0), the most widely accepted voluntary international standard for accessibility, are referenced in the Section 508 refresh, and the effective date for enforcement and compliance with this new Final Rule will begin January 18th, 2018. If you’d like to do some more reading on the subject, Karl Groves does a great job explaining “compliance” under the ADA in his blog post <a href="http://www.karlgroves.com/2017/05/23/website-accessibility-in-the-united-states-what-are-your-requirements-under-the-ada/">"Website Accessibility in the United States: What are your requirements under the ADA?"</a>.
    
    Before continuing, I want to say that I am a big proponent of web accessibility standards. The W3C, IDPF and similar organizations have developed standards and specifications that have made an enormous impact on web accessibility. Web accessibility could not exist without technical standards. Like any goal or aim, web accessibility requires “rules” or “standards” to abide by in order to achieve and measure success. However, when goals are <em>only</em> guided by compliance with a standard, a satisfactory result is the best we can hope for.
    
    Often times, accessibility is viewed solely as a technical skill and is not approached until the end of development. Quality Assurance testing may detect accessibility issues, or an accessibility consultant might perform an audit that tests for accessibility compliance against WCAG 2.0 and/or Section 508. All issues documented in the QA testing or audit are directed to the development team. Accessibility is treated as a feature or pass through QA, becomes the responsibility of one role (the developer), and the product reflects the methodology - a retrofitted, costly mess. Not only will countless hours and dollars be spent on remediating the issues, the finished product may STILL be inaccessible to users with disabilities. Technical compliance does not equate to a positive user experience, and has immense limitations in achieving an experience that is accessible to users with disabilities.
    
    Now, let’s jump to WCAG 2.0. This technical standard is methodology-neutral, and its success criteria can be applied to several roles within a team. Accessibility issues can occur at several different entry points within a project, including:  business requirements, user stories, wireframes, style guides, code, etc. Scaling the WCAG 2.0 success criteria in which the development team can assume primary ownership is the easy part (sort of). What is much more difficult to scale, is the design decisions that take place within the various stages of a project. Development teams can be directed towards specifications, code examples, and even techniques that the W3C provides to assist in passing WCAG success criteria. Similar techniques can be applied toward user stories, wireframes, etc.; however, the answer is not as simple as the developer referencing the WAI-ARIA spec for the expected keyboard behavior on an accordion. Design decisions cannot often be determined by referencing a spec. These decisions can only truly be guided by human-centered design principles.
    
    When accessibility is only tackled through the lens of the “compliance mindset," the product becomes disconnected from the user. Further, the product is not being designed to meet the user’s needs, but a technical standard. WCAG 2.0, Section 508, and any other technical standard certainly play a large role in creating digital products; however, when development does not truly embrace a user-centric methodology, accessibility cannot be achieved. Collectively, an organization must view accessibility as a design tool rather than a technical standard if they truly want to make great digital products for all users.</div>";}
