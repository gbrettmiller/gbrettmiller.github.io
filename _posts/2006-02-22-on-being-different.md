Our differences are to be celebrated. Just look at [Apple Computer&#8217;s Think Different](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_Different) campaign. It is through our differences that we as a society grow. At the same time, it is our similarities to one another that allow us to continue to exist as a society. 

Since posting [Disabled? Or Different?](http://29marbles.blogspot.com/2006/02/disabled-or-different.html) a few days ago, I&#8217;ve been thinking more about what it means to be different in the world today. Wade Rankin has helped me focus these thoughts with this excerpt from his post [Our children are smart. Now what?](http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006/02/our-children-are-smart-now-what.html)

> [She] correctly argues that autistic individuals should not be forced to think or act like so-called “normal” people. Nevertheless, the human race has a social construct that favors those that are able to use their individual gifts in ways that benefit society as a whole. We may struggle to change the negative views that have traditionally been assigned to autism, but humankind’s basic social nature will not change. Even for someone like [her], who has overcome adversity and prejudice to a remarkable extent, making a contribution is not easy.

No one should be forced to act &#8220;normal&#8221;, but the fact is those who don&#8217;t will always be isolated somewhat from society. If I walk down the street and turn a circle every couple of steps, people are going to avoid me. No one&#8217;s forcing me to walk a straight line down the sidewalk, but if I don&#8217;t then I must be willing to accept the consequences. 

I agree wholeheartedly that society needs to learn to be more accepting of those who are more than just a little different, but at the same time I think those who choose to be different _(is that flame-bait, or what?)_ need to be more accepting of the &#8220;normalness&#8221; of the world around them and realize that if they want that world to accept them they have to at least make an effort, no matter how small, to &#8220;fit in.&#8221;
