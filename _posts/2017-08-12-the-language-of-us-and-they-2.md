    We first came across <a href="http://www.shevin.org/articles-harmonica.html">this poem</a> by <a href="http://www.shevin.org/bio.html">Mayer Shevin</a> many years ago when we were first coping with a diagnosis of autism, and found copies of it recently when were doing some spring cleaning.  You can find more about it at the links above, but I've included it below:<blockquote>We like things.<br>     They fixate on Objects.<br><br>We try to make friends.<br>      They display attentions seeking behavior.<br><br>We take a break.<br>      They display off-task behaviors.<br><br>We stand up for ourselves.<br>      They are non-compliant.<br><br>We have hobbies.<br>      They self-stim.<br><br>We choose our friends wisely.<br>      They display poor socialization.<br><br>We persevere.<br>      They perseverate.<br><br>We love people.<br>      They have dependencies on people.<br><br>We go for a walk.<br>      They run away.<br><br>We insist.<br>      They tantrum.<br><br>We change our minds.<br>      They are disoriented and have short attention span.<br><br>We have talents.<br>      They have SPLINTER SKILLS.<br><br>We are human.<br>      They are ?????????????????</blockquote>Kind of takes me back to <a href="http://29marbles.blogspot.com/2005/03/freaks-geeks-and-aspergers-syndrome.html">Luke's question</a>, "When is an obsession not an obsession."<br><br><em>tagged as: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/autism" rel="tag">Autism</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/aspergers" rel="tag">Asperger's Syndrome</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/poetry" rel="tag">Poetry</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/Mayer+Shevin" rel="tag">Mayer Shevin</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/luke+jackson" rel="tag">Luke Jackson</a></em><div class="blogger-post-footer"><p align="center">(c) by Brett Miller 2005-2008

The links no longer work, but the poem and its point is just as relevant as ever. 

A different kind of double standard.
