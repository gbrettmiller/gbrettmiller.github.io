Yesterday I participated in a [Twitter party](http://www.theonlinemom.com/secondary.asp?id=632) hosted by [@TheOnlineMom](http://twitter.com/TheOnlineMom) [*](#TheOnlineMom) to discuss the questions:

> How much do we trust our kids online?  
> Can we monitor them closely and build trust?

The focus of the discussion was, as the topic questions hint at, how do we keep our kids safe? How do we protect them from all of the evils lurking out there waiting to swoop in and take advantage of them? Perhaps the biggest question, though, was: **How do we protect our kids from themselves online**?

It was a great discussion (you can see it at [#TheOnlineMom](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23TheOnlineMom)), but it reminded me a lot of a not so pleasant PTO meeting about kids online that I attended a couple of years ago, when my kids had just started high school.  I&#8217;m not sure what I was expecting from the meeting, but you can probably imagine my horror when I realized that the basic point of the meeting was for internet safety experts to tell us how evil the internet is and that unless we did something our kids would end up dead in a ditch somewhere at the hands of a sexual predator.

OK, so that&#8217;s a bit of an exaggeration, but not by much. The focus of the meeting was indeed the evils that lie in wait for our kids, and what we as parents should &#8211; MUST &#8211; do to protect them. You can see much of what they talked about on the district&#8217;s [Internet Safety Resources for Parents](http://www.pkwy.k12.mo.us/news/stories.cfm?ID=EC39D23B-1279-93A5-5D27449B3409DD22) page.

I had a hard time sitting still through this and not speaking up as they brought out negative after negative (after negative). I waited until the Q&A and then asked what I thought was a reasonable question: Do you (the school district or the presenters) have any related presentations that describe the **positive opportunities the internet provides to our kids**?

It wasn&#8217;t the first time &#8211; I&#8217;m sure it won&#8217;t be the last &#8211; that people looked at me like I had two (or seven) heads.

A big part of the problem, as I saw it then, was that so few of the parents in the meeting actually used the internet themselves. A case of ignorance breeding a deep fear of the unknown. Amazingly, I saw some of the same thing last night in the discussion, comments like &#8220;I hope my kids never hear about Facebook&#8221; (from parents of very young kids) to the question, &#8220;Many parents ask whether there is any learning value in social networks for teens, what do you think?&#8221;

Here&#8217;s how I responded to that last question:

> Social networks &#8211; virtual or real life &#8211; are the primary way that everyone learns, teens included.

Unlike that PTO meeting all those years ago, the discussion last night also included quite a few voices of (what I would call) reason, parents who see more than just the potential dangers. But even so, there was very little discussion of the power of the internet in the hands of our kids, especially teenagers arguably going through the most potentially creative time of their lives.

What if, instead of simply warning our kids about the dangers of the internet, monitoring (or trying to) their every keystroke, and [telling them they can&#8217;t do this or that](http:// "How'd that work out for your parents with you?"), we start by showing them what they CAN do online, how they CAN use all of the incredible tools available to accomplish what they want to accomplish. All of the incredible places they can go online, all the things they can learn, and everything they can share with the world (besides those racy photos or gossipy rants)?

As I shared with the group last night, my job as a parent is not to protect my kids from the world, it is to **teach them how to protect themselves**. Not just in a &#8220;defensive&#8221; way, but by taking the offensive, **understanding the world so they can go out and make their own mark**.

Fear, and caution, have their place. But you can&#8217;t let them rule your life. This is what we should be teaching our kids.
