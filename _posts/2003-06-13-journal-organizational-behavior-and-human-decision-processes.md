Amazing what you find when you Google. Who would have thought there is a journal dedicated to [Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes](http://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/0749-5978)? Guess there is a journal for everything (and rightly so!)

Go [here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=JournalURL&_cdi=6978&_auth=y&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=964293322d38ed4ec944c4d365b4557a) for a free on-line sample issue. I&#8217;m going there as soon as I finish posting this.
