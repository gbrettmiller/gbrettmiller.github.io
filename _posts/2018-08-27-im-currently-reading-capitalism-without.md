I&#8217;m currently reading [Capitalism without Capital: The Rise of the Intangible Economy](https://www.amazon.com/Capitalism-without-Capital-Intangible-Economy/dp/0691175039). Quite relevant to the idea of thinking in bits. 

From [Bill Gates&#8217; discussion on his book blog](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Capitalism-Without-Capital): 

> If you want to understand why this matters, the brilliant new book Capitalism Without Capital by Jonathan Haskel and Stian Westlake is about as good an explanation as I’ve seen. They start by defining intangible assets as “something you can’t touch.” It sounds obvious, but it’s an important distinction because intangible industries work differently than tangible industries. Products you can’t touch have a very different set of dynamics in terms of competition and risk and how you value the companies that make them.
