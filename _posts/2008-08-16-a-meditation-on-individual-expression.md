A couple of weeks ago, I posted a [meditation on censorship](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com/2008/07/a-meditation-on-censorship/). In light of all the recent discussion surrounding the film Tropic Thunder, I thought I should post this companion meditation on individual expression:

> Emperors uphold censorship,  
> But extreme repression leads to extreme reaction.  
> Individualists believe in freedom,  
> But extreme expression leads to extreme reaction.

To answer the question I posed in [my last post](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com/2008/08/pop-culture-has-power-does-it-also-have-a-responsibility/), &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t believe the creators of pop-culture have a responsibility for limiting their content to what is &#8216;acceptable&#8217;.&#8221; The nature of art is individual expression, and in that the &#8216;artist&#8217; is responsible only to himself.

As the meditation above states, though, this unlimited expression might result in &#8220;extreme reaction.&#8221; Artists must accept the consequences of their expression. If they offend or anger a group of people, or even individuals, they should expect those people to express their own feelings. This could be a blog post, a letter to the editor, or a boycott.

In the case of Tropic Thunder, I don&#8217;t agree with calls for the film to be changed or for it to not be shown. That is an extreme on the &#8220;censorship&#8221; end of the spectrum. I do, however, support those who call for a boycott or other action against by individuals or groups about the film. That is an acceptable reaction to the individual expression of the film-makers.
