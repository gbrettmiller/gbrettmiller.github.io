It&#8217;s been a busy week or so, and I am still pulling together a review of [The Speed of Dark](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com/category/books/speed-of-dark-books/), but I jotted a note to myself to blog this last weekend following the Republican National Convention and all the furor surrounding Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and her newborn son with Down&#8217;s Syndrome.

Over the weekend, and with the news about Gov. Palin still fresh and in rotation, my iPod mix shuffled itself to Sinead O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s version of Phil Coulter&#8217;s  &#8220;Scorn Not His Simplicity&#8221;, written about his young son with Down&#8217;s Syndrome.

  = = == === =====<br /> See the child<br /> With the golden hair<br /> Yet eyes that show the emptiness inside<br /> Do we know<br /> Can we understand just how he feels<br /> Or have we really tried
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
  See him now<br /> As he stands alone<br /> And watches children play a children&#8217;s game<br /> Simple child<br /> He looks almost like the others<br /> Yet they know he&#8217;s not the same
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
  Scorn not his simplicity<br /> But rather try to love him all the more<br /> Scorn not his simplicity<br /> Oh no<br /> Oh no
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
  See him stare<br /> Not recognizing the kind face<br /> That only yesterday he loved<br /> The loving face<br /> Of a mother who can&#8217;t understand what she&#8217;s been guilty of
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
  How she cried, tears of happiness<br /> the day the doctor told her it&#8217;s a boy<br /> Now she cries tears of helplessness<br /> and thinks of all the things he can&#8217;t enjoy
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
  Scorn not his simplicity<br /> But rather try to love him all the more<br /> Scorn not his simplicity<br /> Oh no<br /> Oh no
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
  Only he knows how to face the future hopefully<br /> Surrounded by despair<br /> He won&#8217;t ask for your pity or your sympathy<br /> But surely you should care
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
  Scorn not his simplicity<br /> But rather try to love him all the more<br /> Scorn not his simplicity<br /> Oh no<br /> Oh no<br /> Oh no<br /> ===== === == = =

  I first heard the song many years ago when O&#8217;Connor first released it, and if you are a parent of an autistic child hearing it for the first time you can imagine my reaction.   I&#8217;d love to hear yours.
