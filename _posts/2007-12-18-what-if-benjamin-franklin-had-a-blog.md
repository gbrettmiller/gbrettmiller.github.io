<img width="154" height="189" align="right" title="Portrait of Benjamin Franklin" alt="Portrait of Benjamin Franklin" src="https://i0.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Benjamin_Franklin_by_Jean-Baptiste_Greuze.jpg/180px-Benjamin_Franklin_by_Jean-Baptiste_Greuze.jpg?resize=154%2C189" data-recalc-dims="1" />Last summer I had the opportunity to ask [Dr. Blaine McCormick](http://www.baylor.edu/christianleadership/index.php?id=36965 "Baylor University:  Blaine McCormick"), author of [Ben Franklin: America&#8217;s Original Entrepreneur](http://www.shelfari.com/books/24186/Ben-Franklin "Shelfari.com:  Ben Franklin"), what he thought Franklin would think of the internet, social networking software, and blogs. McCormick&#8217;s response was along the lines of, &#8220;Franklin probably wouldn&#8217;t pay much attention to them, blogs are not up to the right standard.&#8221;

I have to admit, I don&#8217;t really agree with McCormick&#8217;s assessment. I think that his response to my question comes partially from an ignorance on his part of what blogs and the other tools are and what they are capable of, and partially from confusing the sometimes dismal quality of blogs, etc and the potential of the tools themselves. (Remember, having good [tools do not the master make](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/2006/tools-do-not-a-master-make "NSL:  Tools do not the master make").)

In the hands of Benjamin Franklin, a master of getting his message out in the media of the day, I can only imagine how the media tools of today could be used. (I&#8217;m sure it would be much more than a [simple collection of links](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/2007/the-web-log-is-10-tips-for-new-bloggers-from-original-blogger-jorn-barger "NSL:  The web log is 10...").)
