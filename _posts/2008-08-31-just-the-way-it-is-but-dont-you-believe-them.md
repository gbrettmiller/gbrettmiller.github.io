Frequent readers of this blog know that in my attempt to understand autism better, I have a tendency to see connections in things that aren&#8217;t always directly related to autism.  A lot of times this will come in the form of a song, a TV show, or a main- or sub-theme in a movie (like the [X-Men trilogy](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com/2006/04/more-thoughts-on-autism-inspired-by-the-x-men-film-trilogy/)).

My post yesterday brought to mind [Bruce Hornsby](http://www.brucehornsby.com/)&#8216;s (excellent) song, The Way It Is (from the [album of the same name](http://www.brucehornsby.com/album_the_way_it_is.htm)).

> They say, &#8220;Hey little boy you can&#8217;t go

> Said, &#8220;Hey old man

&#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe them.&#8221;  Don&#8217;t listen when someone tells you that you can&#8217;t change things, that this is how it was meant to be.  Nothing is &#8220;meant to be&#8221;, that is the wonder of being human, that we determine what is for ourselves.

Note that in the chorus after the last verse, Hornsby never says &#8220;don&#8217;t you believe them&#8221;.  I don&#8217;t know if this was intentional or not, but it is definitely true.  You can make a law, you can tell people what they have to do, but you can&#8217;t tell them how to think about others.  That takes education, persistence, and persuasion.

And that, I believe, is the challenge we all face in gaining more understanding and acceptance for autistics, indeed for all people who are different.
