[<img title="stem cell harvest" src="https://i1.wp.com/healthcare.zdnet.com/images/stem-cell-harvest.jpg?resize=121%2C121" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="121" height="121" align="right" data-recalc-dims="1" />](http://healthcare.zdnet.com/?p=629)I was catching up on some news this evening, reading about [stem cells here in Missouri](http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/sciencemedicine/story/2FA34FEDA1A070CB86257575000F4F38?OpenDocument), with iTunes on shuffle, as usual. About half way through the article, [Dream Theater](http://www.dreamtheater.net)&#8216;s song [The Great Debate](http://www.darklyrics.com/lyrics/dreamtheater/sixdegreesofinnerturbulence.html#4) (from [Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Inner_Turbulence)) came on. I had to stop and listen.

If you know the song, you know that it is a discussion about then-President Bush&#8217;s decision concerning stem cells back in 2001. Here&#8217;s what [wikipedia has to say](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Debate_(song)) about the song:

> &#8220;**The Great Debate**&#8221; is an innovative song by the progressive metal band [Dream Theater](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_Theater "Dream Theater") dealing with the topic of [stem cell research](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell_research "Stem cell research"){.mw-redirect}. It opens with various sound bytes of individuals&#8217; beliefs and opinions concerning this contentious topic. Both sides of this debate are represented lyrically, and the band challenges the listener repeatedly with the chorus phrase- &#8220;Are you justified in taking life to save life?&#8221; and &#8220;Do we look to our Unearthly Guide?&#8230;or to white coat heroes, searching for a cure?&#8221;

What really struck me is how little seems to have changed in the last 7 1/2 years.  Consider these verses from the song:

> <span style="font-family:Verdana;">What if someone said<br /> Promise lies ahead<br /> Hopes are high in certain scientific circles<br /> Life won&#8217;t have to end<br /> You could walk again</span>
> 
> <span style="font-family:Verdana;">What if someone said<br /> Problems lie ahead<br /> They&#8217;ve uncovered something highly controversial<br /> The right to life is strong<br /> Can&#8217;t you see it&#8217;s wrong</span>

Or, as they say toward the end of the song, **miracle potential** vs. **the sanctity of life**. Much the same as what is being said this week.

The stem cell debate reminds me quite a bit of another great debate:  [vaccines and autism](http://news.google.com/news?pz=1&ned=us&hl=en&q=autism+vaccine).  Though the substance of the two debates is different, they are qualitatively very similar: no matter what evidence or arguments are presented, it is very unlikely that you will ever change the opinion of someone who actually has an opinion.
