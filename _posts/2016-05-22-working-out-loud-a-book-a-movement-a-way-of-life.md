I first came across the idea of making work visible in [Jim McGee](http://mcgeesmusings.net/)&#8216;s 2002 blog post <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.mcgeesmusings.net/stories/2002/03/21/KnowledgeWorkAsCraft.html" rel="nofollow">Knowledge work as craft work</a>, and the idea of &#8220;working out loud&#8221; in [Bryce Williams](https://thebryceswrite.com/about/)&#8216; blog post [When will we Work Out Loud? Soon!](https://thebryceswrite.com/2010/11/29/when-will-we-work-out-loud-soon/) I have used both as guides not only in how I get my own work done but in helping others understand how to get the most out of Enterprise Social Networks.

<span style="line-height:1.7;">Author <a href="http://workingoutloud.com/about/">John Stepper</a> developed these ideas further in his 2014 blog post, </span><a style="line-height:1.7;" href="http://workingoutloud.com/blog/the-5-elements-of-working-out-loud">The 5 elements of working out loud</a><span style="line-height:1.7;">, and even further in his recent book, </span><a class="jive-link-book" style="line-height:1.7;" href="https://www.milsuite.mil/book/recommendedbooks/2095">Working Out Loud: For a better career and life</a><span style="line-height:1.7;">.  I have a feeling this book will join those other posts as guides to how I get work done. </span>

I encourage you to read the book, and to keep up with John over at his website. If you&#8217;re not convinced by this brief testimonial, check out John&#8217;s [recent talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpjNl3Z10uc) at TEDx Navesink.
