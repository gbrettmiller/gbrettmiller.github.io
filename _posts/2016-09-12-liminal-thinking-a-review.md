I had the pleasure a couple of years ago of hearing [Dave Gray](http://xplaner.com/) talk about and explore some ideas he had for a new book, throwing them out to the audience and having a conversation around them. Earlier this year I had the privilege of reading some early versions of pages that had evolved from those explorations and which now form the heart of Dave&#8217;s new book, [**Liminal Thinking**](http://liminalthinking.com/). I was excited to get the final version of the book and looking forward to sitting down and breezing through it, to soak it all in like a blast from a fire hose. And, at about 150 pages, it would be easy enough to do. To just read through it in one sitting, in probably just a couple of hours. Which is what I was expecting to do. Until&#8230;

Until I read Chapter 1, titled &#8220;Beliefs are models&#8221;. And then I wasn&#8217;t in a hurry any longer. I wasn&#8217;t interested in getting to the end, I wanted to read that chapter again. Even though he started with the story of the blind men and the elephant, a story I&#8217;ve heard many times before. A story I&#8217;ve heard before, but not really &#8220;seen&#8221; before.

Not surprisingly, this process repeated itself as I made my way through the book. Though I only made it from front to back once over the weekend, I figure I read the entire book at least 3 times in that period. Reading a chapter, re-reading it, maybe going back a chapter or two to make a connection. And I realized that, contrary to my original thought of just blasting through the book, I didn&#8217;t really want to get to the end. I didn&#8217;t want the experience of the book to be over.

And speaking of the experience of the book, I need to mention here just how beautifully designed the book is. Beyond the insight and knowledge in the words and drawings Dave gives us, the team at [The Heads of State](http://theheadsofstate.com/) have created a work of art in this book. The most obvious aspect is the cover, but as you read through the book the design elements guide you along, quite unobtrusively, to help you get the most from those words and drawings. Simple touches like the spare use of color, consistent layout of the chapters so that you know when one is starting and when it is ending, and materials that feel luxurious in the hand. Not to mention the fountain pen friendly paper. Do yourself a favor, and get the hard copy book. (Though I will probably also pick up a Kindle version so that I can always have the book on hand.)

At one point in the book Dave acknowledges that some people naturally or intuitively think liminally, and I count myself among those just as you may. I&#8217;ve always thought &#8220;in systems&#8221;, trying to understand the why behind rules, traditions, and behavior. But, as I learned from Dave in this book, I have only been scratching the surface, getting down to maybe the level of a person&#8217;s beliefs, maybe their theories about life and the world. Beliefs, as Dave explains, go much deeper than that.

More importantly, I realized that I&#8217;ve never really turned that systems view on myself, on my own thinking, to understand how it is I&#8217;ve come to be the way I am. I&#8217;ve always thought I understood, but now I&#8217;m not so sure. I am looking forward to finding out.
