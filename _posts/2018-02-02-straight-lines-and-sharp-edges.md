_I&#8217;m sitting on a plane as it boards, wanted to jot down some quick thoughts. I&#8217;ll come back in later to clean it up, add some links (that you are going to want to check out) and make it a bit more coherent._ 

In a blog post earlier today, Jim McGee discussed the boundary between strategy and tactics, how it used to be &#8220;well defined&#8221; &#8211; some people did strategy, some did tactics, and the two didn&#8217;t really overlap. But how it never really was so cut and dried and how we are realizing that. But we aren&#8217;t the first.

I&#8217;m currently reading Walter Isaacson&#8217;s new bio of Leonardo da Vinci, and one of the things that marked him as different in his time (and any time before him) was his realization that there are no straight lines or sharp edges in nature, and his incorporation of this knowledge into his art.

Then of course fractals and complexity.

Speaking of which, Dave Snowden recently wrote about the liminal spaces between the different sections of Cynefin. For example, the boundary between complexity and the complicated; going from one to the other is not a straight line boundary, there is an overlap.
