One of the dangers of new technologies/trends is the tendency for people to just use it because it is there. The world of blogs is no different. While personal blogs can get away with a bit of frivolity and not work to any real purpose, business blogs need to look at things just a little bit differently. 

On that is note is [**When A Business Shouldn&#8217;t Blog**](http://www.businessblogconsulting.com/2005/08/when_a_business.html) from [Business Blog Consulting](http://www.businessblogconsulting.com) with a nice, short summary of some do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts (or, more accurately, why&#8217;s and why not&#8217;s). I&#8217;ve been looking at how blogs could help my wife&#8217;s personal training practice, and this provided a much needed sanity check.
