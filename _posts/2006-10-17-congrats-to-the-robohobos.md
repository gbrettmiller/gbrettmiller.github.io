<img hspace="10" align="left" title="The Robohobos" width="160" height="100" id="image60" alt="The Robohobos" src="http://nostraightlines.files.wordpress.com/2006/10/robohobos1.jpg?resize=160%2C100" data-recalc-dims="1" />Each fall, middle and high schools from several states gather together for a friendly robotics competition. [BEST (Boosting Engineering, Science, and Technology) Robotics](http://www.bestinc.org/MVC/ "BEST Robotics Inc: Middle and High School Robotics Competition") puts on this competition with the goal of increasing student&#8217;s interest in (you guessed it) engineering, science, and technology. This past Saturday, schools from Missouri and Illinois gathered at St. Louis University for [Billiken BEST](http://www.slu.edu/billikenbest/purpose_billiken_best.html "Billiken BEST - St. Louis University"), the local hub competition.  
As the father of a member of the Parkway North High School Robotics team, the [Robohobos](http://www.geocities.com/pnh_robotics/ "Welcome to the Homepage of Parkway North High's Robohobos"), I&#8217;d like to congratulate them on their [achievements at the event](http://www.slu.edu/billikenbest/2005_gameday.html "Billiken BEST 2006 Game Day results"):

By placing 2d in the Game, the Robohobos have qualified to compete at the [Frontier Trails](http://www.uafortsmith.edu/FTBEST "Frontier Trails BEST - UA Fort Smith") regional event at the University of Arkansas &#8211; Fort Smith in a couple of weeks. I&#8217;ll let you know how it turns out.
