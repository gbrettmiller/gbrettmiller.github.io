Several years ago (has it really been almost 5 years?!?) I wrote a somewhat tongue-in-cheek blog post entitled &#8220;[My dad is a knowledge worker](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/2004/my-dad-is-a-knowledge-worker)&#8220;:

> While I was reading Martin Roell’s [Terminology: “Knowledge Worker”](http://www.roell.net/weblog/archiv/2004/09/23/terminology_knowledge_worker.shtml), a TV commercial I saw a while back came to mind: elementary school students were telling the class what their dads did for a living, and after a couple of well defined jobs (policemen, construction, etc.) were announced one boy proudly stood up and stated, “My dad’s a pencil pusher!” I don’t remember what the commercial was for, but the imagery stuck with me I think for the same reason Geoffrey Rockwell, as described by Martin, doesn’t like the term “knowledge worker”: the job title gives you no real idea of what the job is.

Apropos of what I&#8217;m not entirely sure, but this old post came to mind earlier today when I was thinking about some ideas related to [Work Literacy](http://www.workliteracy.com).  It occurred to me that calling someone &#8211; say a Systems Engineer like me &#8211; a &#8220;knowledge worker&#8221; would be like calling [Albert Pujols](http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=405395) an &#8220;athlete&#8221;.  (Not that I&#8217;m comparing myself to Albert!)

Sure, he is an athlete, but he is a very specific type of athlete, in a sport that requires a very specific set of skills and experiences. You can not get across what he does, or what he must be able to do, with a generic description of &#8220;athlete&#8221;. Like all athletes, though, there is a core set of skills and abilities that Pujols must have simply to be able to consider participating as an athlete in his specific sport. Fitness, endurance, flexibility, etc., all things common to most athletes.

In the same way, each individual knowledge/concept worker is a very specific type of k/c worker, requiring a very specific set of skills and experiences in order to do the work they do.  But like athletes, there is a core set of skills and abilities that anyone who would be a k/c worker must have. And that core set of skills and abilities is, I believe, what the term &#8220;[work literacy](http://www.workliteracy.com/about)&#8221; should encompass.

The question then, of course, is what makes up this core set of skills and abilities?

_(As you may be thinking, I am not the first to raise this question &#8211; visit [WorkLiteracy.com](http://www.workliteracy.com) for more on the subject. On completing this post, I realized that it was simply my way of putting the question into a context that made sense to me.  I hope it makes sense to you, too.)_
