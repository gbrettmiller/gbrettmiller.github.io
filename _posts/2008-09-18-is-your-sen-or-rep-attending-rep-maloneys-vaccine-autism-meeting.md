As the folks at Age of Autism have pointed out, Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) is hosting a special briefing next Wednesday (24 September 2008) for Members of Congress and their Staff to update them on recent developments in the vaccine-autism debate.  I took their advice (kind of) and sent my Senators and Congressman a quick note about the meeting:

> Dear &#8230;  ,
> 
> On Wednesday 24 September, Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) is hosting a special briefing for Members of Congress and their Staff to update them on recent developments in the vaccine-autism debate.  As the parent of an autistic son, now 17, I&#8217;m asking that you not spend the valuable time of you or your staff at this meeting.
> 
> As you may have guessed, I don&#8217;t subscribe to the belief that vaccines, or anything in them, cause autism. All of the science to date has found no causal link between the two, and my own personal experience does not lead me to think otherwise.  (My other son, age 15, is not autistic.)
> 
> I do encourage you and your staff to become involved in the discussion about autism.  I believe that the most effective use of your time and influence would be in the areas of improving availability of services for children with autism, education and support for parents of autistic children, and &#8211; perhaps most importantly &#8211; improvement of services and support for adults with autism.
> 
> Thank you for your consideration of this matter.
> 
> Sincerely,

Or in other words:  Don&#8217;t waste your time on this, there are other more productive things you could &#8211; SHOULD &#8211; be doing for children with autism, their parents, and adults with autism.
