Clicking through links on the Autism Bloggers Ring (see the bottom of this page for the links), I found myself at [Our Aspergers Teenage Boy](http://aspergerteen.blogspot.com). In a [recent post](http://aspergerteen.blogspot.com/2006/01/mom-reports-tommy-is-getting-smart.html), Mom reports: 

> Tommy is getting smart-mouthy. This is <span style="font-weight:bold;">normal teenager stuff that gets treated differently because of his Aspergers</span>. He is also starting to fight doing schoolwork.

I&#8217;ve written a bit before about how it is hard to tell sometimes whether things that come up are because of Z&#8217;s autism or because he is a teenager. Mom&#8217;s post above, expecially the bolded part (my emphasis, btw) got me thinking:

We expect our NT kids to &#8220;act out&#8221; and rebel at some point, because it is &#8216;normal&#8217;, but seem to try to stop our autistic/Aspie teenagers from &#8220;acting out&#8221; because we want them to _be_ &#8216;normal.&#8217;

Just seems kind of odd. Definitely a delicate balancing act we parents (all of us) have to perform.
