In my [last post](http://29marbles.blogspot.com/2006/03/raising-autism-awareness-where-to.html), I posed myself the question of what aspect of autism should I focus my awareness efforts on this year for Autism Awareness Month, and on what audience should I focus those efforts. After just a little bit of thought, I realized that the audience I want to reach out to are the parents of children newly diagnosed as autistic. By deciding on this audience, the topics I should focus on also became clear to me: all of them.

One of the hardest times for most parents of autistic children is when they first receive the diagnosis. This is due in large part, I believe, to the widespread lack of knowledge or understanding of autism by the general public. 

Until they receive this diagnosis, most people don&#8217;t know much, if anything, about autism and after they receive the diagnosis there is a crash rush to learn everything as soon as possible. While there is not a whole lot I can do to change first situation, no matter how many &#8220;awareness campaigns&#8221; I embark on, I can do something to help parents in the second situation. 

To that end, I&#8217;ve created [Autism for Parents](http://autismforparents.wordpress.com). Though based on the [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org) blog system (and hosted at [WordPress.com](http://www.wordpress.com)), my intent is to make it more than just a blog, including pages listing various other resources I think will be of interest to parents. 

I am also hoping to make [Autism for Parents](http://autismforparents.wordpress.com) comprehensive as I can, to help parents get a feel for the entire landscape. Though I have my own beliefs concerning autism &#8211; and will continue to write about them here at [29 Marbles](http://29marbles.blogspot.com) &#8211; I will include information about those views I don&#8217;t agree with. In any decision making process, it is vital to understand all sides of a question before making a decision. I feel it is only right to help parents see all aspects of the issue before making the right decision for them.

I hope to see you there.
