I got my hands on an [iPod Nano](http://www.apple.com/ipodnano) this weekend. It&#8217;s my brother&#8217;s, and I&#8217;ve been helping him try to get it up and running on an older Windows 2000 machine. To say that it has been a pain in the ass would be an understatement; it&#8217;s been a nightmare. I don&#8217;t if it is because it is an older machine, slow processor, what. It meets the system requirements listed on the Apple site, but still it is trouble.

As I said the machine is an older Compaq running Win2k SP4. Because it didn&#8217;t have USB 2.0, we installed a new card. I installed the software straight from the CD. Hooked up the iPod. It kind of works, kind of doesn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s the frustrating part.

Just to make sure the iPod itself was OK, I hooked it up to my G5 iMac running Tiger. Worked like a charm. Hooked it back up to the Win2k machine. Return to the nightmare.

This is my first attempt trying to use an iPod on a Windows machine, I&#8217;m a Mac guy myself. But I can&#8217;t imagine that this is the typical experience for Windows users. (Though it does remind me why I abandoned the Windows ship when OS X came out.)

If anyone who happens to read this has any thoughts or suggestions, I&#8217;d love to here them.
