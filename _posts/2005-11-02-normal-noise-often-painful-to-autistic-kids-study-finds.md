I don&#8217;t think that any parent of an autistic child (or autistic kids/adults themselves) will be surprised by the findings of this study: Noise, even &#8216;normal&#8217; noise, bothers a lot of autistic kids. What I found most interesting about the study results, at least as reported in [this story in the NZ Herald](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&ObjectID=10353070), is the grouping of autistic and gifted children together in the study&#8217;s findings. 

The so-what of the findings is expressed very well by Stuart McLaren of Massey University in the wrap up to the story:

> Providing quiet spaces is one way to help autistic and gifted children, and researchers will investigate other strategies.
> 
> &#8216;Much of the present work is focused on these children being integrated into regular early childhood education environments.
> 
> &#8216;However, we must look more closely at the learning environment too,&#8217; says Mr McLaren.
> 
> &#8216;**Why is it acceptable to expect autistic children to negotiate their way around any such environment when we never expect children with physical disabilities to negotiate their way up a flight of steps?**&#8216;
