When did teaching start being seen as such a bad career choice, the last resort of &#8220;those who can&#8217;t&#8221;? We (as a collective society) revere coaches in sports, and go to great lengths to find great coaches for our precocious little athletes.

Why don&#8217;t we give the same respect and support to, and expect the same greatness from, our kids&#8217; first &#8220;life coaches&#8221;, their teachers?
