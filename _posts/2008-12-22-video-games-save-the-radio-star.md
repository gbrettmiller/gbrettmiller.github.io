It may be true that &#8220;video killed the radio star&#8221; back in the early &#8217;80s, but it looks like video games are coming the rescue here in  the late &#8217;00s.  From the AP story [Boom in music video games helps original artists](http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gSViaOH-i84iMB8pkALaxY3_rZkgD956U0AG3):

> Artists from Nirvana to the Red Hot Chili Peppers have seen sales of their music more than double after being released on the games [[Rock Band](http://www.rockband.com) and [Guitar Hero](http://www.guitarhero.com)].  Some bands are featured on special editions — like Aerosmith on &#8220;Guitar Hero&#8221; this year and, soon, The Beatles with MTV Games — and last month, The Killers released two new songs on &#8220;Guitar Hero&#8221; the same time their latest album came out.
> 
> Aerosmith made more money off the June release of &#8220;Guitar Hero: Aerosmith&#8221; than either of its last two albums, according to Kai Huang, co-founder of RedOctane, which first developed &#8220;Guitar Hero.&#8221;

And yes, in case you are wondering, we do have Rock Band in the house and I can tell you it is a blast to play.  What&#8217;s really great, at least to me, is the ability to download and play all that good classic rock I grew up on &#8211; like, for instance, the entire Moving Pictures album from Rush!  The kids have been introduced to all that good old stuff, and I&#8217;ve actually picked up a few new things, too.

Interestingly, this turn of events is actually helping the artists more than it is the record companies:

> Although labels get some royalties from the play-along games&#8217; makers, they are often bypassed on image and likeness licensing deals, which the bands control and which account for a rising proportion of musicians&#8217; income. Meanwhile, the Recording Industry Association of America pegged its U.S. members&#8217; sales at $10.4 billion in 2007, down 11.8 percent from the year before, with a further drop expected for 2008. By comparison, sales of music video games more than doubled this year, hitting $1.9 billion in the past 12 months, according to NPD Group. And they&#8217;re expected to keep growing.
> 
> Though Warner Music Group Corp. Chief Executive Edgar Bronfman Jr. bemoaned the &#8220;very paltry&#8221; licensing fees record labels get from game makers in August, the labels haven&#8217;t stopped sending their music to game makers.
> 
> That&#8217;s partly because they lack leverage. Even the largest label, Universal Music Group, controls just a third of the U.S. market, said Wedbush Morgan entertainment analyst Michael Pachter.
> 
> &#8220;There are literally probably 2 million songs out there, and fewer than a 1,000 were used in these two games combined in these last two years,&#8221; Pachter said. &#8220;If Warner wants to say we&#8217;ll take our 20 percent of the market and go away, a lot of bands are going to leave the label if they think they can get better exposure by being on these games.&#8221;

Amazing to me, after all this time, that the record labels still don&#8217;t seem to get it.  They are still trying to make a buck selling **product**, when what people want to buy is **content**.
