I&#8217;ve long believed that the prevelance of knowledge work in organizations today will (eventually) fundamentally shift the employee &#8211; employer relationship. In many ways, knowledge workers will come to be &#8220;self-employed&#8221; in the sense that they are working to improve themselves and to make an impact on the world at large and not just within the company they happen to be &#8220;working for&#8221; at the time.

With 401k plans allowing for retirement planning independent of a specific job or pension plan, and for various other reasons that are well documented elsewhere, knowledge workers don&#8217;t seem to be staying in the same place for their entire careers anymore. With retirement taken care of, other things today&#8217;s employees need to consider include health/life insurance, etc. A truly self-employed knowledge worker also has to worry about the business end of things, such as billing&#8217;invoicing, taxes, payroll, etc. etc. 

By working &#8220;for&#8221; a company, knowledge workers are in many ways simply out-sourcing the business end of being self-employed so they can focus on the job itself. 

This obviously raises some interesting questions for organizations&#8230;.
