My early days in Knowledge Management included a lot of time developing, deploying, and getting people to use &#8220;knowledge repositories.&#8221; (At least _trying_ to get people to use them.) A worthwhile endeavor in some regards, I&#8217;ve always had misgivings about the whole idea, at least how it has been implemented in most cases. The cheapness of mass storage these days, and the way we just keep everything, has nagged at this misgiving over the past couple of years. 

I finally realized one day that the problem has become not, &#8220;How do we remember all this knowledge that we&#8217;ve learned?&#8221; but rather, &#8220;How do forget all this knowledge we&#8217;ve accumulated that we no longer need so we can focus on what we do need?&#8221; This same question has come up, albeit in a different context, in that other domain in which I blog: autism. 

[MOM &#8211; Not Otherwise Specified](http://momnos.blogspot.com/) recently posted a very [interesting piece about the role of memory](http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/11/only-memory.html), and the inability to purge it, in autistic behaviors. In her post, she quotes Paul Collins&#8217; new book **The trouble with Tom**: 

> Memory is a toxin, and its overretention &#8211; the constant replaying of the past &#8211; is the hallmark of stress disorders and clinical depression. The elimination of memory is a bodily function, like the elimination of urine. Stop urinating and you have renal failure: stop forgetting and you go mad.

This also plays on my [long-held dislike of best practices](http://nsl.blogspot.com/2005/08/on-best-practices.html), at least how most people implement them. If you are so caught up in what has happened before, it is hard to get caught up in what is to come.
