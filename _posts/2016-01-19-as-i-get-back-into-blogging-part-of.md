As I get back into blogging, part of my challenge is to find the right theme, the best presentation. To be honest, I&#8217;ve kind of been using this lack as an excuse for not blogging, and I just need to get over it. Though I&#8217;ve not been actively blogging (writing) for the past couple of years, I have been keeping up with the state of the art, such as it is, and what others have been doing with blogging platforms. Especially [Dave Winer](http://scriptingnews.com).

I keep coming back to WordPress. I love the platform, and its evolution as a full blown CMS is great, so much possibility. But all I really want for my blog is a place to write. And for people to read. Although, even when I was actively blogging years ago I never really expected that many people would actually read what I wrote on my blog. I always expected they would read it in an RSS feeder. My how times have changed.

I know that images and pictures are all the rage on websites and blog sites and everywhere, but all I really want is something nice and clean for text. With the occasional image or video. I&#8217;m using the Mercury theme, a child theme to P2, because it is clean, text based, and has the added bonus of creating and editing directly on the posts page, but there are a few things I don&#8217;t like. Mainly in the styles for the post formats, but a couple of other things as well.

So, you say, why not create your own theme? Or at least create your own P2 child. Well, I probably will. Maybe a good time to start learning JavaScript with WordPress?

Speaking of which, here is Matt&#8217;s State of The Word talk from WordCamp US back in December.
