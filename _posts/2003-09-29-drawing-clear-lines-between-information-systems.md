In my many ramblings through the wwweb, especially through various blogs and k-logs, I came upon this little gem &#8211; [Drawing clear lines between information systems](http://www.steptwo.com.au/papers/cmb_competingplatforms/index.html). When you read through it you may think, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s obvious!&#8221; 

I thought the same thing as I read through it. Then I thought, &#8220;Well, if it is so obvious why are we still having all these problems described in the paper?&#8221; As I&#8217;m sure you will see when you think about the paper (assuming you read it), it is one thing to know what you should do, and quite another to figure how to do it (and then, of course, actually do it!).
