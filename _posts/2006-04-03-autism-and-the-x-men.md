I was kind of paying attention to the TV this weekend when the trailer for [X-Men III: The Last Stand](http://www.x-menthelaststand.com/) came on. I really started paying attention when the character of Storm said:

> There&#8217;s nothing to cure! This is who we are.

If you&#8217;re not familiar with the X-Men series of movies &#8211; or the Marvel comic books on which the films are based &#8211; the basic story is of a group of &#8216;mutants&#8217; and their struggle to gain acceptance by non-mutants, aka humans.

The basic premise of this third of three movies is that the government (humans) have found a &#8220;cure&#8221; for mutant-ism and is trying to force mutants to be &#8216;cured.&#8217; As you can probably tell from the quote above, the mutants don&#8217;t want to &#8211; DON&#8217;T THINK THEY NEED TO BE &#8211; cured. 

(Sound familiar yet?)
