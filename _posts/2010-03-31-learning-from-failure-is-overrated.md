That&#8217;s what I wrote in my copy of [Rework](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307463745?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0307463745) at the end of the &#8220;Learning from failure is overrated&#8221; section. It came to mind last night as I was reading [Children With Disabilities and Making Mistakes](http://www.aspieweb.net/protecting-children-disability-mistakes/). In the article, Zach brings up one of the (often true) stereotypes about parents of disabled kids &#8211; [overprotectiveness](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/autism-and-the-helicopter-parent/) &#8211; with some thoughts on the importance of mistakes.

> Parents don’t realise how them being overprotective is in fact harmful to their children’s development. The number one way people learn, yes including those with disabilities is by making mistakes. If people are not allowed to make mistakes they will never learn. Parents of children with disabilities often protect their children from being able to make mistakes, thus they never learn.

This is, according to the guys from [37signals](http://www.37signals.com/rework), a common misconception. What you really learn from, they say, is success.

Even though these two things sound like &#8211; are &#8211; opposites, there is a common theme that unites them: you can&#8217;t fail or succeed if you never try anything. And that is really what overprotective parents are guilty of: giving in to their own _fear_ of failure and not letting their kids try things. Sadly, this approach more often leads to [mediocrity than to excellence](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/which-do-you-fear-more-failure-or-mediocrity/).

And the last thing kids need, especially kids with disabilities, is their parents dooming them to a life of mediocrity.
