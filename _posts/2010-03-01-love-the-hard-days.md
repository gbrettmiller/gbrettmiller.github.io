How often do you hear people say, &#8220;I sure hope today is an **easy** day&#8221;? Probably quite often. How often do you hear people say, &#8220;I sure hope today is a **hard** day&#8221;? Probably not quite as often.

Someone who knows the value of  the hard days is [Cesar Millan](http://www.cesarsway.com/), aka the [Dog Whisperer](http://www.cesarsway.com/dogwhisperer). On a recently aired episode of his show, while observing the behavior of a new client and assessing the difficulty ahead (which in this case was significant), Cesar looked at the camera and smiled.

&#8220;I love days like this.&#8221;

He knew it was going to be a hard day, not only for him but for the dog and its owners. But he wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way, because he understands that it is only on the hard days that you can achieve great things.

So, love the hard days when they come, they are a gift and your chance to shine.
