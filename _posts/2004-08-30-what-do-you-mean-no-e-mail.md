Could you live without your e-mail for a day? That&#8217;s the question posed by Eric Mack in [More productive with[out] e-mail?](http://www.ericmackonline.com/emo/emonline.nsf/dx/more-productive-without-e-mail) After a brief history of e-mail&#8217;s climb to the top, Eric points to **[They&#8217;ve got less mail](http://blog.fastcompany.com/archives/2004/08/27/theyve_got_less_mail_.html)**, a _Fast Company_ article about the Veritas Software marketing department making Friday a &#8220;no e-mail day&#8221;. 

> On Fridays, it&#8217;s half that many. Now his employees talk face to face. Or they pick up the phone. They&#8217;re more productive on days like today because there&#8217;s less miscommunication and less time spent crafting notes just so.

Has e-mail become a productivity drain? Based on the way it is used in most organizations today, I would say YES. Does it have to be that way? 

NOPE.
