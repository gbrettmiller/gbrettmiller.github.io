Quite often as a I read stories and blogs about autism, I find something that I want to return to later or that I want to note with a short comment but don&#8217;t have the time nor inclination to blog.Â  So I&#8217;ve been trying to use [Delicious](http://www.delicious.com), the social bookmarking site, to help me do that.Â  Because I thought that the people who subscribe to and read this blog might be interested in what I&#8217;m bookmarking, I used the Link Splicer feature in [FeedBurner](http://www.feedburner.com) to include my bookmarks in my FeedBurner feed for this blog.Â  Which worked fine, except&#8230;.

I had failed to take into account how this would impact my feed&#8217;s presence on the [Autism Hub](http://www.autism-hub.co.uk)&#8216;s own feed.Â  Apparently,Â  because the Hub feed is set up as an aggregator and not RSS a simple link to the site I bookmarked &#8211; instead of a link that showed the bookmark link along with my comments &#8211; is what Hub subscribers saw.Â  (I must admit, I never click the links for my own posts in the Hub feed ðŸ˜‰Â  So, I&#8217;ve disabled the Link Splicer feature to alleviate this problem.

If you are interested in my delicious autism feed, there are three ways you can see it:

  1. I have added my delicious autism feed as a widget on the blog site, so you can see it there.
  2. You can visit [my delicious autism tag](http://delicious.com/gbrettmiller/autism) page.
  3. You can subscribe to the [my delicious autism RSS feed](http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/rss/gbrettmiller/autism), and get it in your feed reader of choice.

You may also be interested in the [complete set of autism tagged bookmarks](http://delicious.com/search?p=autism), too.
