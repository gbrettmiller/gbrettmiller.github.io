I learned the importance of rehearsal while in the military: Plan an operation, try it out, refine the plan. Last night I mentioned to some friends how I use rehearsal in my day-to-day life: Preparing for a presentation, walking through the steps of a plan, practicing a process. Especially when it is something important.

In [Not my fault Guv&#8230;](http://www.cognitive-edge.com/blogs/dave/2008/03/not_my_fault_guv.php "Cognitive Edge:  Not my fault Guv..."), Dave Snowden highlights the value of rehearsal on a larger scale:

> I find it difficult to believe (well maybe I don&#8217;t) that after producing a major engineering project on time and budget, a combination of BA and BAA could combine to [mess up](http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/2/hi/uk_news/7317909.stm) the opening day of Terminal 5 at Heathrow. _Delays at the staff carpark_ are in part to blame! People failed to unload bags fast enough, the queues were too long. Hi guys, ever heard of rehearsal? Simulation software?

Of course, the really sad part is how poorly BA and BAA responded when everything went to hell. Which, of course, Dave discusses as well. Check it out.
