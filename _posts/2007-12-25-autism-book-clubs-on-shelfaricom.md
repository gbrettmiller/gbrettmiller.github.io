One of the various reasons I finally got around to posting [my review of Portia Iverson&#8217;s Strange Son](http://29marbles.blogspot.com/2007/11/tale-of-two-mothers.html) was my signing up for an account at [Shelfari.com](http://www.shelfari.com), a social networking site to connect those who still engage in the f[ading activity of reading](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/2007/books-books-and-more-books). As I was adding books to my shelf I wanted to add a review of at least one book, so I dusted off that review and [posted it to Shelfari](http://www.shelfari.com/books/777296/Strange-Son), as well as here (where it would, admittedly, reach a bit larger audience).

One of the other things that Shelfari provides is the ability to create groups, what seem to me to essentially be a virtual book club. I created one, [Books by Autism Parents and Autistics](http://www.shelfari.com/groups/16774/about), to provide a forum to discuss, well, books by autism parents and autistics. So far, the group is just me. I&#8217;d love to have some company. (hint hint ðŸ˜‰

On a side note, I understand that there are several different sites for managing a book shelf and that converting from one to another is a bit of a pain. I actually went through this when switching from iRead within Facebook to Shelfari. (I wrote a bit about the myriad options, and headaches they cause (for me, at least) in [Time out, please?](http://www.shelfari.com/groups/16774/about) last summer.) If you don&#8217;t want to switch your entire shelf over to Shelfari, perhaps just come on over for the group discussion.

Hope to see you there.<span style="font-style:italic;"><br /></span>
