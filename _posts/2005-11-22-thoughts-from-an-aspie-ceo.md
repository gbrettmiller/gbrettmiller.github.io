In an [interview about his company BitTorrent](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10099449/site/newsweek/), CEO Bram Cohen had this to say about his Asperger&#8217;s: 

> **You&#8217;ve been open about being diagnosed with Asperger&#8217;s syndrome. How has that affected you as a software author and as a CEO?**  
> It makes you less emotional when you&#8217;re coding. It&#8217;s like you don&#8217;t take it personally when the computer doesn&#8217;t work well. I&#8217;m still relatively new to the CEO thing, so ask me that question in a couple years.
> 
> **What&#8217;s the biggest misconception about Asperger&#8217;s?**  
> That people with Asperger&#8217;s are immoral, which isn&#8217;t true at all. People with Asperger&#8217;s frequently don&#8217;t understand what&#8217;s going on, and don&#8217;t know how to express what they&#8217;re thinking, but that&#8217;s very different from not wanting to do the right thing.
