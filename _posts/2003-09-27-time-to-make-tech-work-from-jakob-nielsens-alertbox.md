As I was putting together a business case to focus on making better use of the IT assets we currently own instead of buying/developing more, I received an e-mail notification for [Time to Make Tech Work (Jakob Nielsen&#8217;s Alertbox)](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20030915.html). Perfect timing.

Though the article is full of good ideas, three of them stand out for me (in my current situation):

</p> 

  * Security as default  
    </p> 
      * e-mail must be reconceptualized (also discussed in [another AlertBox entry](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/990919.html))  
        </p> 
          * We need an Internet Control Panel&#8230;  
            </ul>
