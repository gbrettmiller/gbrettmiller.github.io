The article **[Some autistic kids&#8217; parents dispute criticism of nontraditional treatments](http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2006/jan/1283638.htm)** addresses familiar themes about the validity (or not) of &#8216;alternative&#8217; treatments for autism such as chelation, special diets, hyperbaric chambers, etc. Nothing really new.

But there were a couple of paragraphs in the story that caught my eye (emphasis mine): 

> Joseph was born healthy at 5 pounds, 14 ounces. He developed normally, his parents said, until he was about 10 months old, when he began to flap his hands, a common behavior with autistic children.
> 
> He started talking and interacted well, but then his language regressed. He had tantrums. He&#8217;d lie on the floor, pace or jump.
> 
> His parents, both lawyers, felt Joseph was being stolen from his body. But <span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="font-style:italic;">several pediatricians</span></span> said not to worry.

It is disturbing to think that one parent could find &#8220;several&#8221; pediatricians consecutively that don&#8217;t seem to understand the early indicators of autism. This doesn&#8217;t seem to present a very good image of the state of the level of knowledge about autism in the medical profession.
