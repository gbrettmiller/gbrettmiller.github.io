I came across the following quote from author [Vladimir Nabakov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Nabokov "Vladimir Nabakov - wikipedia"), used in Edmonds&#8217; and Eidinow&#8217;s book [Bobby Fischer Goes to War](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060510250?ie=UTF8&tag=29marbles-blog-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0060510250 "amazon.com - Bobby Fischer Goes to War"):

> There is nothing abnormal about a chess player being abnormal. This is normal.

Just seemed like something I should post.
