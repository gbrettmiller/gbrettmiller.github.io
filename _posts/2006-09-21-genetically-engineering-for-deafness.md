I had the TV on MSNBC this evening for about 2 minutes, during Tucker Carlson&#8217;s show. Here&#8217;s (a paraphrase of) what I heard Tucker say:

> Some deaf parents want to be able to test for deafness. They want to make sure that their children are deaf like them. <span style="font-style:italic;">[blah blah blah]</span> Now, it&#8217;s one thing to genetically engineer the sex of your kids, but can&#8217;t you agree that genetically engineering your kids so that they are born deaf is just wrong? 

His guest, of whom I know nothing about, hedged and didn&#8217;t really answer. I&#8217;m not even really sure what the show was about (like I said, I only saw about 2 minutes and didn&#8217;t pay a whole lot of attention). But, given the discussions I&#8217;ve been involved in through this blog, those couple of lines just kind of jumped out. Got me thinking.

I think I&#8217;ll wait to discuss in more detail until I&#8217;ve had a chance to read the [transcript](http://msnbc.msn.com/id/3719710/) this weekend, but I&#8217;m sure it will be on my mind.
