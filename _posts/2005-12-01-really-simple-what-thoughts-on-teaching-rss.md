I used to think that I kind of understood RSS, and could even explain it to people. By the end of the first morning at BlawgThink a couple of weeks ago I realized that I didn&#8217;t know nearly as much as I thought I did, and understood even less. 

[Jack Vinson](http://www.jackvinson.com) talks about teaching RSS, and points elsewhere, in [Teaching RSS](http://blog.jackvinson.com/archives/2005/11/29/teaching_rss.html): 

> Marshall Kirkpatrick gives us a very nice discussion of what he does when teaching RSS to people. [Teaching RSS: A Discussion](http://marshallk.com/teaching-rss-a-discussion)
