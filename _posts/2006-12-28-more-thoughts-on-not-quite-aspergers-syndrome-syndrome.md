In my post &#8216;[Not-quite-Asperger&#8217;s-Syndrome Syndrome](http://29marbles.blogspot.com/2006/12/not-quite-aspergers-syndrome-syndrome.html)&#8216; I intentionally kept the satirical/sarcastic tone of the [original article](http://www.ridiculopathy.com/news_detail.php?id=1725), my only acknowledgment of the true nature of that article being an emoticon at the end and a [&#8216;satire&#8217; technorati tag](http://technorati.com/tag/satire). Most of the conversation I&#8217;ve seen on this article &#8211; some [resulting from my original post](http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/12/on-validity-of-self-diagnoses.html) &#8211; has been critical of the intent and execution of the article. I must admit, though, that I found it &#8211; if not humorous &#8211; entertaining and well-aimed. (For more discussion on the original article, check out [How DARE They! What Do NTs Know Anyway?](http://community.livejournal.com/asperger/1365773.html)) 

A recent episode of the TV show **[House](http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/09/27/092103.php)**, which Joseph also mentions in his response-post and which [Autism Diva blogged](http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/2006/09/autism-in-house.html), came to mind.

But my real thoughts were along the lines of, &#8220;Wow, now we know that autism awareness is increasing. If someone can make fun of autism and autistics in such a knowledgeable way, that means they are aware of the issues.&#8221; Or, as [griffen quotes Gandhi](http://community.livejournal.com/asperger/1365773.html?thread=23286541#t23286541)

> First they ignore you. Then they fight you. Then they laugh at you. Then you win.

I&#8217;m not sure this means that we &#8216;win,&#8217; whatever that may mean in the context of autism awareness, but I see this as progress in our fight. As an individual, it is sometimes painful to be at the butt of a satire. But solid, well-informed satire is good for society. And this, I think, gets to the heart of some of the key issues surrounding autism (and disabilities in general), at least in my mind.

At what point do the needs/rights of society at large outweigh the needs/rights of individual members of that society? Or, maybe even more to the point, do the needs/rights of society **ever** outweigh the needs/rights of an individual?

No answers from me, at least not this year.

Happy New Year everyone, and keep up the good fight!
