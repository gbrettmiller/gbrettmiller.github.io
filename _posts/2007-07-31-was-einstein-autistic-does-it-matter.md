When I started reading Walter Isaacson&#8217;s new biography of Albert Einstein, one of the first things I did was look in the index to see if autism or Asperger&#8217;s was listed. No on both counts. 

As I&#8217;ve read the book, I&#8217;ve found myself unconsciously evaluating the information presented through a diagnostic lens, trying to decide if he was indeed autistic. (See this [Google search](http://www.google.com/search?q=einstein+autism+autistic) for a lot of discussion about the topic.)

I&#8217;ll post my thoughts on the matter after I&#8217;ve finished the book and had the chance to digest it all, but in the meantime the following question came to mind:

> <span style="font-weight:bold;">Does it really matter if Einstein were autistic or not?</span>
