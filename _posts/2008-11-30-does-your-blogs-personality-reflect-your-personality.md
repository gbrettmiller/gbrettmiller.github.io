Recently, Dave Snowden and Jack Vinson have both [typealyzed](http://www.typealyzer.com/) their blogs:  [Dave&#8217;s is ENTP](http://www.cognitive-edge.com/blogs/dave/2008/11/saturday_morning_silliness.php) and [Jack&#8217;s is INTJ](http://blog.jackvinson.com/archives/2008/11/30/typealyzer_says_my_blog_is_intj.html).  Since I&#8217;m not sure exactly how Typealyzer works, I wasn&#8217;t sure if I&#8217;ve got enough content here at this new blog (15 posts so far) to get a type, but figured it was worth a shot.  The verdict:  INTP &#8211; The Thinkers.

><img title="INTP - The Thinkers" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.typealyzer.com/images/INTP.gif?resize=148%2C190" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="148" height="190" align="left" data-recalc-dims="1" /> The logical and analytical type. They are especialy attuned to difficult creative and intellectual challenges and always look for something more complex to dig into. They are great at finding subtle connections between things and imagine far-reaching implications.
> 
> They enjoy working with complex things using a lot of concepts and imaginative models of reality. Since they are not very good at seeing and understanding the needs of other people, they might come across as arrogant, impatient and insensitive to people that need some time to understand what they are talking about.

Interestingly, maybe not surprisingly, this is typically what I get back after taking a personality type indicator test.

Being the curious person that I am, I also checked to see how other blogs I write (or have written) are typed:

> [No Straight Lines](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com): INTJ &#8211; The Scientists  
> [29 Marbles](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com): INTP &#8211; The Thinkers  
> [Tramp and Tumble](http://trampandtumble.blogspot.com): ISTP &#8211; The Mechanics  
> [St. Louis Elite](http://www.stlouiselite.org): ESTP &#8211; The Doers

The first two are, of course, my personal blogs that have since merged into the current blog, so it is no surprise &#8211; at least to me &#8211; that they turned out to be what they are.  I write it primarily for myself, so the topics are what interest me and the style is what I&#8217;m comfortable with.

The third, The [Tramp and Tumble Blog](http://trampandtumble.blogspot.com), is a site I maintain to get information out to parents, athletes, and coaches in the sport of Trampoline and Tumbling.  The topics I choose are still somewhat based on what interests me, since I&#8217;m a parent of a T&T athlete, but the style of writing is based more on what I think the readers would appreciate than what I would like to see.

The last, the web site for the non-profit that supports [St. Louis Elite Trampoline and Tumbling](http://www.stlouiselite.org), is primarily targeted at outsiders to the sport of T&T and intended to get them excited about the sport and the team so that they will support the team financially or in some other way.  It&#8217;s nice to know that this site comes across as a &#8220;Doer &#8211; They are especially attuned to people and things around them and often full of energy, talking, joking and engaging in physical out-door activities&#8221;.

In general, I agree with Dave that one shouldn&#8217;t take these types too seriously and that they shouldn&#8217;t be used for &#8220;categorising people into little boxes&#8221;.  I do, however, think that these types of tools can help individuals gain some personal insight into their &#8216;natural&#8217; tendencies.  It is obviously possible to overcome these tendencies when the situation demands it, if you simply use it for what it is &#8211; another tool in the toolbox.
