So maybe &#8211; just as the predicted point at which computers make cleverer computers than themselves and go into a cycle building ever cleverer machines until they are wiser than all human thought, maybe capital has reached or is rapidly approaching its own singularity &#8211; the point at which it generates more and more capital in an unstoppable cycle and without a moment&#8217;s thought for the humans it was once meant to serve.
