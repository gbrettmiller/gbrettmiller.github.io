At the [Soulard Idea Market](http://thenonbillablehour.typepad.com/nonbillable_hour/2006/07/soulard_idea_ma_1.html "[non]billable hour - Soulard Idea Market") last week (about which [Randy Holloway](http://randyh.wordpress.com/2006/08/13/the-soulard-idea-market-a-successful-yet-unheralded-venture/ "Randy Holloway Unfiltered - The Soulard Idea Market - A successful (yet unheralded) venture") has written and I am going write), [Matt Homann](http://thenonbillablehour.typepad.com/nonbillable_hour/ "Matt Homann - the [non]billable hour") introduced the concept of the &#8216;unreasonable request,&#8217; which [he in turn picked up](http://thenonbillablehour.typepad.com/nonbillable_hour/2005/08/unreasonable_re.html "[non]billable hour - Unreasonable Request") from [Lisa Haneberg](http://managementcraft.typepad.com/management_craft/ "Management Craft"). In the (un)conference setting of the Idea Market, each person was offered the opportunity to post a request on the wall, and every one else had the opportunity to look at these requests and act on them (or not).

At the time of the gathering, I couldn&#8217;t think of anything that really fell into that category. After some interesting discussions with my son this past weekend, however, I have come upon an &#8216;unreasonable request&#8217; that I&#8217;m hoping someone can assist with.

Actually, this is a two part request, the parts being related but unique:

1. Can you help me find somewhere (or someone) where I can get a copy of the US version of [Pokemon Box](http://www.nintendo.com/gamemini?gameid=m-Game-0000-1845 "Nintendo.com Games: Pokemon Box Ruby and Sapphire") for [Nintendo Game Cube](http://www.nintendo.com/channel/gcn "Nintendo.com: Nintendo GameCube")?

  * Pokemon Box is no longer available (at least as far as I could see) at the [Pokemon Center](http://www.pokemoncenter.com "Nintendo:  Pokemon Center").
  * There are non-US versions of Box on e-Bay and other sites, but I&#8217;ve not seen a US version
  * The guys at the local game shop had never heard of Pokemon Box.

2. Can you help me find someone who has a copy of the [Pokemon Colosseum](http://www.nintendo.com/gamemini?gameid=m-Game-0000-1847 "Nintendo.com Games:  Pokemon Colosseum") Promo Disk (again for Nintendo Game Cube) and is willing to part with it for free (or next to free)?

  * This is available on e-Bay and other sites, but for quite a bit more than I&#8217;d like to fork out.
  * I asked at the local game shop, figuring their prices might be a bit better than on e-Bay, but they don&#8217;t deal in Promo Disks (though they said they&#8217;d keep an eye out).

The purpose of this request, if you&#8217;re not familiar with the world of Pokemon, is the elusive goal of &#8220;Gotta catch &#8217;em all!&#8221;

If would like to respond to this request (either part), please drop a note in the comments or feel free to drop me an e-mail at [nsl@gbrettmiller.com.](mailto:nsl@gbrettmiller.com "e-mail to No Straight Lines")
