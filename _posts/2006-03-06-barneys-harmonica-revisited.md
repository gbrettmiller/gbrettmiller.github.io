I originally posted this last April, but felt it worth re-posting. Though most people involved with autism will immediately grasp the incredible insight of the poem, I encourage everyone to read the [story of Barney&#8217;s harmonica](http://www.shevin.org/articles-harmonica.html) that inspired the poem.

&#8211; &#8211; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212;&#8211; &#8212;&#8212;&#8211; &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-  
We first came across this poem by [Mayer Shevin](http://www.shevin.org/bio.html) many years ago when we were first coping with a diagnosis of autism, and found copies of it recently when were doing some spring cleaning. You can find more about it at the links above, but I&#8217;ve included it below:

> We like things.  
> They fixate on Objects.
> 
> We try to make friends.  
> They display attentions seeking behavior.
> 
> We take a break.  
> They display off-task behaviors.
> 
> We stand up for ourselves.  
> They are non-compliant.
> 
> We have hobbies.  
> They self-stim.
> 
> We choose our friends wisely.  
> They display poor socialization.
> 
> We persevere.  
> They perseverate.
> 
> We love people.  
> They have dependencies on people.
> 
> We go for a walk.  
> They run away.
> 
> We insist.  
> They tantrum.
> 
> We change our minds.  
> They are disoriented and have short attention span.
> 
> We have talents.  
> They have SPLINTER SKILLS.
> 
> We are human.  
> They are ?????????????????

Kind of takes me back to [Luke&#8217;s question](http://29marbles.blogspot.com/2005/03/freaks-geeks-and-aspergers-syndrome.html), &#8220;When is an obsession not an obsession.&#8221;  
&#8211; &#8211; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212;&#8211; &#8212;&#8212;&#8211; &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-
