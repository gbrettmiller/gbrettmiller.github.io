What is knowledge? What is knowledge management? (Uh oh, here we go again!) In a [recent post](http://jaarons.typepad.com/dubbings/2005/05/biting_our_own_.html), Jeremy has the following to say about trying to define knowledge:

> Part of the problem, I think, is that there really is no general agreement on what Knowledge Management actually is. And since one&#8217;s definition of knowledge really depends upon one&#8217;s definition of KM the knowledge question won&#8217;t be adequately answered until the KM question is dealt with.

I read the statement twice, then read it again to make sure it said what I thought it said. And it did.

If I had written the sentence above, I would likely have said &#8220;one&#8217;s definition of knowledge management depends on one&#8217;s definition of knowledge.&#8221; Because, after all, how can you manage something if you don&#8217;t know what that something is? (Chicken or the egg?)

But it does get you thinking&#8230;.

&#8211; &#8211; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212;&#8211; &#8212;&#8212;&#8211;  
_Just an interesting note: my second post to this blog, back in June &#8217;03, was entitled **[What is Knowledge Management, anyway?](http://nsl.blogspot.com/2003/06/what-is-knowledge-management-anyway.html)**. Amazing to reflect on how much has been achieved and figured out in that time, but how we are still trying to figure out the answer to the basic question._
