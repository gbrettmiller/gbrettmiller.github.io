&#8230;if the telephone (landline) system is smart enough to tell me that I need to dial a &#8220;1&#8221; before calling a long-distance number, it isn&#8217;t smart enough to just dial the &#8220;1&#8221; for me. My cell phone has no problem with long distance numbers dialed without a &#8220;1&#8221;.
