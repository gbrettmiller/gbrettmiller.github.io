I&#8217;ve always been interested in how the brain works and have read quite a bit on the subject of evolutionary psychology and biology and some on cognitive neuroscience. (Once Zeke was diagnosed as hyperlexic and PDD/ASD, I was **really** interested.) Reading through some of many posts on the neurodiversity vs. biomed debate, I&#8217;ve been thinking about the role of natural selection in the recent &#8220;explosion&#8221; of autism cases. 

I figured before I wrote anything I should do a little research, lit review, etc. In my Google search, I came across [Origins of Autism](http://originsofautism.com/) from 2003 and an earlier paper, [Human Evolution: Evolution and the Structure of Health and Disease](http://serpentfd.org/), from 1998. It&#8217;s late and I&#8217;ve not had a chance to read through either of these in any detail, but they definitely look like they are worth reading. 

I&#8217;m anxious to find out what their conclusions are.
