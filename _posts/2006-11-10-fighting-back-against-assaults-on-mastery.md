While visiting my in-laws this past weekend, I was flipping through some old copies of [Birds and Blooms](http://www.birdsandblooms.com/ "Birds and Blooms magazine") magazine, looking at some landscaping ideas (and the excellent bird photography). On the inside back cover of one issue was a story by a woman who recounted how her grandmother had taught her how to get birds to eat seed out of her hand.

It was a long (several day) process, that required patience and a lot of &#8216;failure&#8217; before the birds were comfortable approaching the woman (then a little girl) and eating from her hand. Though not exactly a tale of &#8216;mastery&#8217;, it nonetheless embodied key aspects of the master&#8217;s path.

In my [last post](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/2006/mastery-on-the-dance-floor-hobby-turned-world-record "Mastery on the dance floor - Hobby turned world record"), I alluded to what George Leonard refers to in [Mastery](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0452267560/ref=pd_sim_b_1/002-0054287-6120840?ie=UTF8 "Mastery - The Keys to Success and Long-Term Fullfillment") as &#8220;America&#8217;s War Against Mastery:&#8221;

    If you&#8217;re planning to embark on a master&#8217;s journey, you might find yourself bucking current trends in American life. Our hyped-up consumerist society is engaged, in fact, in an all-out war on mastery&#8230;.

    The quick fix, anti-mastery mentality touches almost everything in our lives. Look at modern medicine and pharmacology. &#8220;Fast, temporary relief&#8221; is the battle cry.

I was pleased to see that mastery, or at least the ideas of mastery, were fighting back in this war. The grandmother, obviously a true master of birds and blooms (sorry, couldn&#8217;t help myself), passing on her knowledge and wisdom to the next generation. Unfortunately, I was quickly disappointed and realized that the assault on mastery is still in full force.

The article ended with, and indeed turned out to be a prelude to, an advertisement for a &#8216;patented bird attraction&#8217; system that guaranteed you would have birds eating out of hand &#8220;within minutes, on your first try.&#8221; Ack! Phbbt!

In the closing sentence of this chapter Leonard writes:

> In the long run, the war against mastery, the path of patient, dedicated effort without attachment to immediate results, is a war that can&#8217;t be won.

This may be true for the &#8216;big picture,&#8217; but I still have faith in individuals to carry on the good fight.
