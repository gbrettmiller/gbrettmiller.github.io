Ohio State University is setting up a study that will try to identify linkages between the many GI problems noted in autistic children and the autism that affects them. 

> The study is designed to determine whether the medication improves gastrointestinal function and assess any related effects on emotions and behavior. In hopes that relieving the gastrointestinal problems might also help the autism, measures of autistic symptoms are included in the study.

They are looking for people in the Columbus, OH area to participate; contact info is available in this story at [Study Explores Drug&#8217;s Effect On Stomach Problems With Autism](http://www.emaxhealth.com/50/2812.html).
