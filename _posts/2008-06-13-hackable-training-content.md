  Nearly 10 years ago now, I was responsible for customer training for a new piece of equipment we had produced. (Actually, I assumed responsibility about 1/2 way through the project.) After training our first customer, I sat down with the training crew to see how we could make the next session better, as I had seen and heard some things that weren't correct, or could be better.
  
  Silly me.

Nearly 10 years ago now, I was responsible for customer training for a new piece of equipment we had produced. (Actually, I assumed responsibility about 1/2 way through the project.) After training our first customer, I sat down with the training crew to see how we could make the next session better, as I had seen and heard some things that weren&#8217;t correct, or could be better.

Silly me.

Our training vendor politely informed me that the training material was what it was, and it couldn&#8217;t be changed after it had been approved. In fact, they seemed shocked that I even brought the idea up, as if it were some sort of training community heresy. I was not, and am not, a &#8220;training person&#8221; so the attitude was a bit surprising to me.

&#8220;What do you mean, you don&#8217;t want to make your training product progressively better as you learn more about it&#8221; was what was going through my mind. (In fact, I went to my project manager and told him he needed to fire the training vendor we had and get someone who &#8220;knew what they were doing.&#8221;) I&#8217;ve since learned that this was not an isolated incident; on the contrary it seemed to be the standard.

In a post today titled [Learning content should be hackable](http://www.jarche.com/2008/06/learning-content-should-be-hackable/){.black}, Harold Jarche makes the case for content developers to take a lesson from what&#8217;s going on in the rest of the digital world.

<blockquote title="Harold Jarche - Learning Content Should be Hackable">
  <p>
    However, there is one principle that is not taught or followed in instructional design that would really reflect the nature of the Web. There should be a principle of making learning content <a href="http://www.jarche.com/2007/10/hacker-manifesto/">hackable</a>, so that it can change with the times, the needs of instructors or learners. Licenses such as <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/ca/">CC-By-NC</a> would allow remixing. Perhaps we need a special “<strong>CC-Education Remix</strong>” license.
  </p>

    Anyway, if you want your content to live a long, healthy and even diverse life; make it easier to hack.

Good advice for any content developer, but especially for learning content developers.
