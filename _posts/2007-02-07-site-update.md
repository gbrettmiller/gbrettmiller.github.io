If you read this blog exclusively through an RSS reader, you probably haven&#8217;t seen my site theme updates. I&#8217;m using the same basic theme, just added an extra column to provide a bit more useful/entertaining/productive content for those who do visit the site. If you get a chance, please check it out and let me know what you think.

In addition to the standard stuff (categories, archives, etc.), I&#8217;ve added a bit more personal links. These include a &#8220;Creation&#8221; group, with links to other online content I&#8217;ve created or contributed to, and a &#8220;Consumption&#8221; group, to share some of my recent finds. I&#8217;m still working the &#8220;Consumption&#8221; group out, trying to figure out the best way to present it. In addition to the &#8216;monetized&#8217; items like books and CD/DVD referrals, I plan to include links to blogs I frequent.

Speaking of monetization (is that really a word?), I&#8217;ve also added a section for straight out &#8220;Capitalism&#8221; which includes (of course) Google Ads as well as various other affiliate / referral programs. Still working out the kinks on this one as well, so feel free to let me know how I can make it better. (And &#8211; by all means &#8211; please follow the links and buy something ðŸ˜‰ )
