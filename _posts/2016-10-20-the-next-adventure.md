This is one of my favorite [Hugh MacLeod](https://twitter.com/hughcards) [business card cartoons](http://www.gapingvoidart.com/):

In his [email message accompanying this doodle](http://us1.campaign-archive1.com/?u=028de8672d5f9a229f15e9edf&id=f51b0ab454&e=9a68b4441f), Hugh says it took him &#8220;twenty years to get from the bottom to the top of the pyramid.&#8221; It took me about the same amount of time, a little more or a little less depending on how you count it. Since reaching that point, I&#8217;ve had several most excellent adventures. I&#8217;ve often wondered though:

> How do you know when it is time to start looking for the next adventure?

It&#8217;s easy, of course, and incredibly fun when your next adventure finds you. But in the absence of that, how do you know when the current adventure has become just another project? When it is time to actively seek a new adventure?

Or at least let all those potential adventures know that you are ready for them?
