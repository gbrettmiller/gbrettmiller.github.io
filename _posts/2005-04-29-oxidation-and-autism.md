From [&#8211; Forbes.com](http://www.forbes.com/lifestyle/health/feeds/hscout/2005/04/28/hscout525418.html):

> &#8216;Oxidation is basically burning,&#8217; McGinnis said. &#8216;Chemically, it involves the loss of electrons. A burning match is a clear case of oxidation.&#8217; Other examples include an apple slice turning brown or vegetable oils that go rancid, he said.
> 
> McGinnis&#8217; studies have found that autistic children exhibit high levels of cellular oxidation, which exacerbates the disorder&#8217;s symptoms. To treat this, McGinnis is exploring the intravenous use of important antioxidants such as zinc, magnesium and various vitamins. He said his research has shown some success. &#8216;Some of these kids talk only on the days they get these IV treatments,&#8217; McGinnis said.

Just as autism is a spectrum, so are the apparent causes&#8230;.
