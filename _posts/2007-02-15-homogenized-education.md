[Quite a while back](http://29marbles.blogspot.com/2005/10/why-doesnt-every-child-have-iep.html) I posed the (mostly) rhetorical question, &#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t every child have an IEP?&#8221; 

I was brought back to this train of thought recently by a passage in Roy Richard Grinker&#8217;s [Unstrange Minds](http://astore.amazon.com/29marbles-blog-20/detail/0465027636/002-9091504-7932015) (emphasis is mine):

    To be sure, debate is brewing about whether some of the these higher-functioning children should be classified as autistic or even disabled. Some disability experts contend that the problems encountered in educating children with Asperger&#8217;s Disorder lie less with the individual child than with the educational system. The U.S. educational system, they suggest, has disseminated Asperger&#8217;s Disorder as a category because it is useful to its <span style="font-weight:bold;">attempt to make the student body as homogeneous as possible</span>. The paradox they identify is that a child who <span style="font-weight:bold;">doesn&#8217;t fit in has to be seen as somehow impaired</span> in order to justify an effort to normalize him.

This trend toward &#8216;homogenized education,&#8217; an attempt to make sure that everyone[*](#footnote) learns the same thing in the same way, reminds me of many &#8211; mostly misguided &#8211; attempts to do something similar in business. If you&#8217;ve ever heard the term [Business Process Engineering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Process_Reengineering "wikipedia - Business Process Reengineering"), you know exactly what I&#8217;m talking about. 

The fallacy in this approach, of course, is that education and learning are not processes that lend themselves to efficiency. Not perfect efficiency, anyway. That&#8217;s not to say that their aren&#8217;t things that can be done to improve the process. 

But identifying a process and then trying to make everyone adhere to, and excel in, that process just won&#8217;t work in education (just like it doesn&#8217;t work in business).

<span style="font-style:italic;"><a name="footnote">*</a> An exception to this are the &#8220;gifted&#8221; children, which I wrote about <a href="http://29marbles.blogspot.com/2006/03/other-end-of-spectrum-special_06.html" title="The other end of the spectrum: special education for gifted kids">here</a>.</span>
