From the Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain, Department of Clinical Neurology, University of Oxford is a paper titled [Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI): A &#8220;window&#8221; into the brain.  
  
](http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fmri_intro/fmri_intro.htm) A very good, detailed introduction into basic brain functions and how fMRI works (also a little bit about how it is different from a standard MRI).
