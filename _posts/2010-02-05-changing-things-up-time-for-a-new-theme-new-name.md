My focus on this blog is on the content, so I try not to mess around with the design/layout very much. There comes a point, though, when things need to be relooked and freshened up, and that time has come around again.

I&#8217;ve been looking at different themes, with an eye on going even more minimal than I already am. Every time I&#8217;ve considered going really minimal, I still always end up with something a bit more &#8220;busy&#8221; than what I really wanted. After reading [Linchpin](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/seth-godin-wants-you-to-become-a-linchpin/), I now realize that I was just giving in to the resistance, doing what I thought others would want or expect me to do. Â (Who are these &#8220;others&#8221;, anyway?)

After some quick research, I&#8217;ve put the [Wu Wei theme by Jeff Ngan](http://equivocality.com/2009/07/08/wu-wei-wordpress-theme/) at the top of my short list of possible themes. I like the look, and the philosophy, of the theme. If you use Wu Wei, I&#8217;d love to hear from you.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1096" title="wu wei preview" src="http://nostraightlines.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/wu-wei.png?resize=491%2C563" alt="" width="491" height="563" data-recalc-dims="1" />](http://nostraightlines.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/wu-wei.png?resize=491%2C563)

As for the name of the blog, I&#8217;m not really sure what I was thinking including the word _cum_ in the title. It doesn&#8217;t really matter that it is a Latin word in a Latin phrase. You would not believe some of the search terms that end up pointing here (OK, maybe you would) just because of that word. A bit on the Colbert Report last night about the renaming of the magazine &#8220;The Beaver&#8221; to &#8220;Canada&#8217;s History&#8221; also got me wondering about how spam filters would treat anything from here.

So, I&#8217;m changing the name to **Brett&#8217;s Waste Blog**. Shouldn&#8217;t be anything too controversial with that. Plus, I think it better reflects what this blog is all about.

This shouldn&#8217;t affect your experience with the blog, especially if you view this mostly through RSS. Just wanted to let you know in case you find your way here sometime and wonder if you are in the right place.
