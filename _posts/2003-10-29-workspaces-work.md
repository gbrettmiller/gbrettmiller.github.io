From [Ray Ozzie](http://www.ozzie.net/blog), creator of [Lotus Notes](http://www.lotus.com/products/product4.nsf/wdocs/noteshomepage) and [Groove](http://www.groove.net), comes this article, with extra references, on [the death of e-mail.](http://www.ozzie.net/blog/2003/10/01.html#a111) Some key points:  


> Anyone who is doing a critical business process online that involves substantial dialog between individuals should NOT be using email at this point in history, and many no longer are.
> 
> Think about the rate of increase of &#8220;noise&#8221; in email over the past two years, which is a very short time. Think about where we&#8217;ll be in as short as five years. Can you imagine?
> 
> If you have work to do with others, online, try workspaces. There are many different types &#8211; from Groove if you like client-based mobility, to SharePoint if you like using Websites. 

Ozzie definitely has a vested interest in everyone using [Groove](http://www.groove.net/), but as you can see from the last quote he also believes in other solutions: whatever works for you.

The thought that hit me the most was the comments about noise in e-mail. The problem today isn&#8217;t too much information, as many complain. Rather, the problem is **too much noise**.
