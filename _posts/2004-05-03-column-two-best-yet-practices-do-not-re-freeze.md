[Column Two: &#8220;Best-yet&#8221; practices &#8211; do not re-freeze](http://www.steptwo.com.au/columntwo/archives/001233.html): In other words, best practices should not be seen as definitive, but rather a milestone on the path. You don&#8217;t just stop when you find a good (best) practice, but you continue down the road. 

Best practices are, after all, only &#8220;best&#8221; in the context they are best in, and no where else.
