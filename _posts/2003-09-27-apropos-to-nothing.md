Going through a bunch of stuff about [Knowledge Management](http://www.brint.com/km/), one of the most common things you come across is the various definitions of things like [data](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=data), [information](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=information), [knowledge](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=knowledge), [wisdom](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=wisdom), etc. etc. Every now and then, you will come across a discussion of [noise](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=noise), but following my recent thoughts on [PowerPoint](http://www.microsoft.com/powerpoint) I don&#8217;t think noise is given quite its due share.

I pick on [PowerPoint](http://www.microsoft.com/powerpoint) for obvious reasons: The actual content in a typical [PowerPoint](http://www.microsoft.com/powerpoint) presentation is a tiny percentage of the total number of bits within a presentation file. Even using [PowerPoint](http://www.microsoft.com/powerpoint) properly, there is usually a huge amount of junk on every slide (pictures, etc) that add no value to the overall presentation. 

When looking at how you can use IT resources effectively, reducing the noise (or more appropriately, raising the [signal to noise ratio](http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid7_gci213018,00.html)) should be right at the top of the list of things to do.
