If there is any theme to my beliefs and thoughts about raising an autistic child, it is this: Raising an autistic child is just like raising any other child, only different. As the parent of two teen-age boys, one autistic and one not, I know the challenges and joys of raising both. 

In the [Columbus Dispatch](http://www.dispatch.com/) article [Autistic kids fall victim to parents who run amok](http://www.dispatch.com/editorials-story.php?story=dispatch/2006/06/04/20060604-B5-02.html), columnist Deborah Kendrick addresses this very theme _(emphasis added)_:

> Anyone who has been a parent has at least one terrible moment where caring for a child seemed unbearable…. None of my children is autistic. They did, however, have special needs, because **all children have special needs**.
> 
> One mom in Autism Every Day states pathetically that her child will never marry. &#8220;How do you know that?&#8221; is what my heart is screaming at her….
> 
> I’ve heard parents of deaf kids, blind kids, kids with Down syndrome and other disabilities make the same kinds of pronouncements: My child will never (fill in the blank). To all of them I say **no human can predict what another human will accomplish**.
