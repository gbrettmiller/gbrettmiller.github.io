This question from [David Kirby](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/contributors/bio.php?nick=david-kirby&name=David%20Kirby) ([as posted at the Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/my-take-on-tim_b_5374.html)) pretty much sums it up: 

> Why is it so controversial to suggest that a known neurotoxin injected directly into the systems of pregnant women, newborns and infant children above federal safety levels MIGHT have caused a neurological disorder in a subset of children with a genetic predisposition against metabolizing mercury efficiently?
