What motivational methods make some of you cringe (or worse)?

This is one of the questions that [Dan Pink](http://www.danpink.com) posed to the group participating in his [live chat at The Book Club](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/bookclub/2010/02/live-chat-dan-pink.html) on the New Yorker. In response to theÂ &#8220;Don&#8217;t make mistakes because I (mgr,owner, boss) will think less of you&#8221; motivational method, he said:

> That&#8217;s one of the most insidious, imho. To me, it&#8217;s one of the greatest flaws in organizations. **People are more scared of failure than of mediocrity.** It should be the reverse. (emphasis mine)
> 
> Making a mistake is like breaking a leg. It happens and you fix it. Mediocrity is like a chronic, cancerous disease that gradually destroys you and from which recovery is far more difficult.

In the short term, mediocrity is &#8220;safe&#8221; and &#8220;going for it&#8221; is not. Or at least it doesn&#8217;t seem to be. (I can&#8217;t go for it, what if I make a mistake?)

Personally, I&#8217;d rather get a few broken bones along the way than spend my life trying to avoid those things that might cause them.

How about you?
