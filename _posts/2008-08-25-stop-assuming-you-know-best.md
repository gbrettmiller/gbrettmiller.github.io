I came across the following in Michael Dowd&#8217;s [Thank God for Evolution](http://www.thankgodforevolution.com/):

> To have a powerful relationship with your own intuition and instincts &#8211; and thus to have a clear channel of communication with the creating, sustaining Life Force of the Universe (whatever you may choose to call It/Him/Her) &#8211; one must cultivate humility in this sense: **_Stop assuming that you know best how things are supposed to go in the world_**. Rather, try on an attitude of gratitude &#8211; not just for what is easy to be grateful for, but also for those challenges and difficulties in life for which you cannot yet detect a silver lining.
> 
> Having faith and being in integrity means trusting that each and every one of us is doing the best we can, given what we&#8217;ve got to work with at the time. It&#8217;s trusting that, from the perspective of the Universe, everything may be &#8220;right on schedule.&#8221;

Just thought I&#8217;d share.
