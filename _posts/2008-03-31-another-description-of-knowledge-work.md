I am just about finished reading [Garry Kasparov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Kasparov "wikipedia:  Garry Kasparov")&#8216;s 2007 book, **<a>How Life Imitates Chess: Making the Right Moves &#8211; from the Board to the Boardroom</a>**, and have been holding off on posting anything about the book until I do get to the end. But the following passage, starting on page 183, caught my eye as an interesting way to look at and possibly define knowledge work:

> Knowing a solution is at hand is a huge advantage; it&#8217;s like not having a &#8220;none of the above&#8221; option. Anyone with reasonable competence and adequate resources can solve a puzzle when it is presented as something to be solved. We can skip the subtle evaluations and move directly to plugging in possible solutions until we hit upon a promising one. Uncertainty is far more challenging. Instead of immediately looking for solutions to the crisis, we have to maintain a constant state of asking, &#8220;Is there a crisis* forming?&#8221;

Solving a puzzle that you know has a solution may require knowledge, but it is knowledge that already exists. Figuring out if there is a solution to a problem, or even if there is a problem at all, requires the manipulation of existing knowledge, the gathering of new knowledge / information, and the creation of something new.

See my earlier post, [A conversation on the nature of knowledge work](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/2008/a-conversation-on-the-nature-of-knowledge-work "NSL:  A conversation on the nature of knowledge work"), and the links in that post for more discussion on those ideas.

_* In this context, Kasparov explains, &#8220;crisis&#8221; is not a disaster, as the word is commonly used, but rather a &#8220;turning point, a critical moment when the stakes are high and the outcome uncertain.&#8221;_
