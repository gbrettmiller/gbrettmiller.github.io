Why do you blog? There are many answers to that question, ranging from &#8220;I just need a place to write down my thoughts&#8221; to &#8220;I want to change the world (and get rich doing it).&#8221; Your answer to that question should play a large part in how you blog. Or at least how you design your blog.

On that note is [Jakob Nielsen](http://www.useit.com/)&#8216;s latest installment of his [Alert Box](http://www.useit.com/alertbox) column, [Weblog Usability: The Top Ten Design Mistakes](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/weblogs.html). 

> Weblogs are a form of website. The [thousands of normal website usability guidelines](http://www.nngroup.com/reports/ "Nielsen Norman Group: research reports about the usability of websites, intranets, and email newsletters"){.old} therefore apply to them, as do [this year&#8217;s top ten design mistakes](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/designmistakes.html "Alertbox: Top Ten Web Design Mistakes of 2005"){.old}. But weblogs are also a special genre of website; they have unique characteristics and thus distinct usability problems.
> 
> To reach new readers and respect your existing readers&#8217; time constraints, test your weblog against the following usability problems.
> 
>   1. No author biographies
>   2. No author photo
>   3. Nondescript posting titles
>   4. Links don&#8217;t say where they go
>   5. Classic hits are buried
>   6. The calendar is the only navigation
>   7. Irregular publishing frequency
>   8. Mixing topics
>   9. Forgetting that you are writing for your future boss
>  10. Having a domain name owned by a weblog service

Obviously, not all of these apply to everyone; it all depends on what you want to accomplish with your blog. Still, I think I have some work to do.
