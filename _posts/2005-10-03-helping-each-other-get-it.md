On my [other blog](http://nsl.blogspot.com) I recently posted [some thoughts](http://nsl.blogspot.com/2005/09/changing-resistance-into-understanding.html) on the book [<span style="font-weight:bold;">They just don&#8217;t get it</span>](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/157675328X&link_code=as2&amp;camp=1789&tag=gbrettmiller-20&creative=9325), a sort of business case-study of two &#8220;opposing&#8221; sides. Key to the resolution of the story in the book is the importance of seeing the question (and solution) from the &#8220;other&#8221; side. While reading the book, the neurodiversity vs. bio-med debate kept popping into my mind, especially with all the various back and forth lately. 

If you&#8217;ve not already seen it, you really should visit [Injecting Sense](http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/) and read [Semantics and Civility](http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2005/10/semantics-and-civility.html). Wade has put together an excellent synthesis of the many topics and ideas that have been floating around the past couple of weeks which I think goes a long way to helping frame this debate from all sides. 

No one is right, no one is wrong, but there <span style="font-weight:bold;">is </span>a way ahead in which everyone comes out ahead.
