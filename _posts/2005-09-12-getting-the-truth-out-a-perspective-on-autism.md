[Kev points](http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/?p=281) to [Getting the Truth Out](http://www.gettingthetruthout.org), a site that he says provides a &#8220;much more realistic look at autism&#8221; than the recently relaunched [Autism Society of America](http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer) website. 

Some thoughts on the site from Kev:

> In places, for us parents, its not an easy read.
> 
> In other places it feels like we as parents have to accept that whilst we know our kids well we donâ€™t know autism as well as autistics.
> 
> In still more places, this is a read full of hope and confirmation that difference is not equatable to bad or something that requires curing.

I&#8217;ve not had the chance to go through the whole site (it is set up as a linear pager turner and takes about an hour to go through, according to Kev), so I can&#8217;t really comment on the site (yet). But it looks like it is definitely worth reading in detail as I try to figure out this thing called autism.
