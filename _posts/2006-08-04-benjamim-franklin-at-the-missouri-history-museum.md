If you live in St. Louis and have not yet visited the exhibit [Benjamin Franklin &#8211; In Search of a Better World](http://www.mohistory.org/content/HomePage/allaboutfranklin.aspx "Benjamin Franklin - In Search of a Better World") at the [Missouri History Museum](http://www.mohistory.org/content/HomePage/HomePage.aspx "Missouri Historical Society - Missouri History Museum") in [Forest Park](http://stlouis.missouri.org/citygov/parks/forestpark/ "City of St. Louis: Forest Park"), I strongly encourage you to check it out before the exhibit closes on September 4. If you are planning to visit St. Louis between now and September 4, make sure you add it onto your itinerary.

If you visit the museum this Sunday (August 6), you can also sit in on a lecture by [James Srodes](http://www.jamessrodes.com/ "James Srodes - Home") (author of [Franklin: The Essential Founding Father](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0895261634/sr=1-1/qid=1154708407/ref=sr_1_1/002-0054287-6120840?ie=UTF8&s=books "amazon.com - Franklin: Essential Founding Father")) and [Peter Earnest](http://cicentre.com/intelligencespeakers/ISB_A-K/SP_EARNEST_E_Peter.htm "Intelligence Speakers Bureau - E. Peter Earnest") (Executive Director of the [International Spy Museum](http://www.spymuseum.org/index.asp "International Spy Museum") in D.C.) entitled [Benjamin Franklin: Master of Intrgue](http://www.mohistory.org/content/EventCalendar/EventSummary.aspx?Date=8/1/2006#8/6/2006 "Lecture - Benjamin Franklin: Master of Intrigue"). Srodes will also be available to sign his book.
