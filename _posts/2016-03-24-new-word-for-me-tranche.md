A month or so ago I came across the word &#8220;tranche&#8221; in an article (or story or something). I consider myself well read with a decent sized vocabulary, but don&#8217;t recall ever having seen that particular word before that article. (Yes, I had to look it up.)

Since then I&#8217;ve seen or heard the word used once or twice a week in varying contexts. Wondering how I missed it all those years, and why it has suddenly started showing up everywhere.

Is it just me?
