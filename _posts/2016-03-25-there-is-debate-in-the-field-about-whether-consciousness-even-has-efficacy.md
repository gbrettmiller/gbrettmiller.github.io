[This neuroscientist is figuring out how to harness the enormous potential of the unconscious mind](http://www.sciencealert.com/discover-the-power-of-the-unconscious-part-of-your-brain)

> We often react to a certain image or a certain word on a deeper level without having to engage the conscious parts of our brain, and it&#8217;s this kind of &#8216;power&#8217; Eagleman is talking about in his research. It&#8217;s still at an early, unpublished stage, but it promises to uncover more about what goes on below the surface of our minds.

Have to admit, I thought much of this had already been hashed out before. Of course the subconscious (unconscious) mind plays a key part in our lives, more so than even the conscious mind.
