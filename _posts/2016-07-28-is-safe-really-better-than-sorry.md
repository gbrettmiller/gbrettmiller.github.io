  It all depends on the context. How you define "safe" and "sorry", the time scale in which you're working. What you want to have written across your tombstone, or in the history books, when your time on this earth inevitably ends.

I first mentioned this tweet from [@codinghorror](https://twitter.com/codinghorror) in my [review of StrangeLoop 2010](https://gbrettmiller.com/2010/11/03/safe-no-awesome-yes-my-review-of-strange-loop-2010/).

      "it's better to be safe than sorry" is such crap. You know what's better than being safe? Being AWESOME.

      It has stuck with me through the years, and always seems to pop up when it&#8217;s needed. Not too long ago (wow &#8211; the better part of a year), I tweeted my own variation on this, exploring a bit the &#8220;is such crap&#8221; part of Jeff&#8217;s tweet.

          The problem with "better safe than sorry" is that it rarely keeps you safe and almost always leaves you sorry.

          It all depends on the context. How you define &#8220;safe&#8221; and &#8220;sorry&#8221;, the time scale in which you&#8217;re working. What you are willing to give up for what you want to achieve. What you are willing to tolerate. What you want to have written across your tombstone, or in the history books, when your time on this earth inevitably ends.
