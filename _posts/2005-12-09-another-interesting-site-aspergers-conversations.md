It never ceases to amaze me what you can find on the Web, in all areas of interest. Obviously in this blog, the information I find and discuss is related to autism. On that note I&#8217;d like to introduce you to [Asperger&#8217;s Conversations](http://welkowitz.typepad.com/): Weekly audio posts by Larry Welkowitz, Ph.D.

I&#8217;ve not had a chance to go through it in detail, but one particularly interesting post to me was [a discussion Dr. Welkowitz recorded](http://welkowitz.typepad.com/aspergers_conversations/files/antiochAdvClass.mp3) with his class on the subject [**Counseling Asperger&#8217;s and High Functioning Autism: Philosophical Dilemmas**](http://welkowitz.typepad.com/aspergers_conversations/2005/11/counseling_aspe.html):

> You be the judge, but I thought that these students (mostly educators, school counselors, and parents) were wary of models that pathologized children with AS/HFA and were moderately skeptical about the role of pharmacology. They were concerned about medication side effects and expressed concerns about superficial understanding of the complexity of these individuals.

I&#8217;m looking forward to going through the whole site in more detail.
