Eisenhower knew that any plan crafted before battle would be obsolete at first contact with the enemy. In his work, Kavazovic wants to be this realistic too. “<strong class="Annotation -strong">Translating this into tech: no long-term plan or product vision survives contact with the user in the product-design sense</strong>. That’s why agile methodology is specifically designed to create user experiences that work,” he says. “It&#8217;s absolutely suboptimal to design a particular product all the way down to years’ worth of features, make that the blueprint, and build it out.” Inevitably, sticking to a rigid long-term plan without a mechanism to iterate on user feedback would result in features users don’t want, costly re-dos and potentially total product failure.
