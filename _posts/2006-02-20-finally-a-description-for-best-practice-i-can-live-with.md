I&#8217;ve written before about my ambivalence toward &#8220;best practices,&#8221; at least how many people define them: one-size-fits-all checklists of things that worked for some successful team in the past that should be used by anyone that is doing anything remotely similar. In other words, tacit knowledge made explicit with no accounting for the context or knowledge of the people/team expected to use the practice.

On the [recommendation of Larry Prusak](http://www.babsonknowledge.org/2006/01/lesserknown_mustread_km_books.htm), I am currently reading [Knowledge, Institutions and Evolution in Economics (The Graz Schumpeter Lectures)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/0415205379&amp;amp;amp;tag=gbrettmiller-20&camp=1789&creative=9325)<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=gbrettmiller-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0415205379" alt="" style="border:medium none !important;margin:0!important;" border="0" height="1" width="1" />. I&#8217;m about 2/3 of the way through, and am still digesting most of it (I have the feeling I&#8217;m going to need to read it again to truly appreciate it!), but the following quote (on page 64) from &#8216;[Routines and other recurring action patterns of organizations: contemporary research issues](http://icc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/5/3/653)&#8216; by [Michael D. Cohen](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22author%3AM.%20D.+author%3ACOHEN%22) _et al_ (published 1996 in [Industrial and Corporate Change](http://icc.oxfordjournals.org/)) caught my eye:

> A routine is an executable _capability_ for repeated performance in some _context_ that [has] been _learned_ by an organization in response to _selective pressures_.

Replace &#8220;routine&#8221; with &#8220;best practice&#8221; and this becomes a description of best-practice that I can live with.
