A sad example of people preying on the desperate from the [Asbury Park Press](http://www.app.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050818/NEWS/508180442/1070/NEWS02) in NJ: 

> Annie Mennicucci was desperate to find help for her 8-year-old autistic son, and in October she thought she found it in Nancie Fisher, a Manahawkin woman who advertised expertise in the disorder. &#8216;She said she&#8217;d have my son talking in two weeks,&#8217; said Mennicucci, a Beachwood resident who paid Fisher $1,500 to serve as an &#8216;advocate&#8217; during special-education meetings with Toms River Regional School District officials.
> 
> Leanne Laboy, a mother in Barnegat, paid Fisher $125 an hour to work as an advocate for her two children who have Asperger syndrome, a form of autism.
> 
> But according to authorities, Laboy and Mennicucci were deceived by Fisher, who stands accused of using fake credentials to win the mothers&#8217; trust. Fisher, 47, was charged by Beachwood and Barnegat police in June with theft by deception. The charges have been forwarded to the Ocean County Prosecutor&#8217;s Office for review, Assistant Prosecutor Martin Anton said Wednesday.
