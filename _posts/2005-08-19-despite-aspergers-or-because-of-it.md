When thinking about the impacts of autism and Asperger&#8217;s Syndrome, it is hard not to focus on the negative aspects. Even the occasional &#8220;silver lining&#8221; is most often considered in a negative sense, as in this quote from [icBirmingham &#8211; Oxford is Jos&#8217;s final destination](http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0100localnews/tm_objectid=15874774&method=full&siteid=50002&headline=oxford-is-jos-s-final-destination--name_page.html): 

> **Despite** suffering from Asperger&#8217;s Syndrome, a mild form of autism, the youngster has already proved himself one of the country&#8217;s brightest children.

If we were to say, &#8220;**Because** he suffers from Asperger&#8217;s Syndrome&#8230;&#8221;, and acknowledge that some good things can (note I don&#8217;t say &#8220;do&#8221;) come from ASD&#8217;s, would that be admitting defeat in our efforts to cure them? Does it necessarily mean that we accept them as just something we have to live with?

I&#8217;m a glass half-full kind of guy, so I prefer to think that we can accept (embrace?) the good while still working to eliminate the bad. What do you think?
