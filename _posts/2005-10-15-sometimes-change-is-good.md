Change. If we are not in control of changes happening to us, change can be a frightening thing. Sometimes, our fears are realized. But sometimes change results in great things. And sometimes, whether we want it or not, ask for it or not, change is just &#8220;what the doctor ordered.&#8221; 

Following our recent move to St. Louis, things changed a lot (obviously). In addition to the obvious major changes, we&#8217;ve noticed numerous &#8220;minor&#8221; changes as we adapt to the new environment. Some of the biggest of these &#8220;minor&#8221; changes have been the result of the new school environments for our kids. 

[Tamar](http://www.postcardsfromla.com/blog/about.html) recently moved as well, in her case from CA to NJ. She has written an [uplifting, yet somewhat tear-jerking, essay](http://www.hiddenlaughter.com/essays/2005/1012.html) about the positive effects of changing schools for her autistic son.
