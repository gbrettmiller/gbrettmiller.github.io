I use [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com) as my RSS reader. I have a habit of checking the &#8220;Keep New&#8221; box on posts that I would like to read in more detail or post about. Checking the box would change the description display to indicate that there was a new post in the subscription.

Unfortunately, I tend to have a lot of these. Which meant that I would quite often open a feed thinking there were new posts only to find that there were only old posts I&#8217;d marked as new. Kind of a pain.

That changed a week or so ago. The Bloglines interface now gives an indication of how many truly new feeds I have as well as the number of old feeds that I&#8217;ve marked to keep as new. They&#8217;ve tried out a couple of different ways of displaying this. Here are the ones I&#8217;ve seen, they may have gone through a couple of other iterations when I wasnt&#8217; looking:

  * <span style="font-weight:bold;">1 : 2</span> 
      * <span style="font-weight:bold;">(1) (2)</span> 
          * <span style="font-weight:bold;">(1)</span> <span>(2)</span></ul> 
            A definite improvement.
            
            On the other hand, MSN has updated their service in a (for me) negative way. I have an MSN account that I&#8217;ve used for a while, though it mostly gets junk traffic these days. Since I prefer to not have to check numerous sites/sources for my mail, I have (had) Outlook set up to check the MSN account. While trying to clear out some old messages, I got an error dialog that basically said, &#8220;If you want to keep accessing MSN through Outlook, you need to pay us.&#8221; 
            
            Guess I&#8217;m not going to use MSN through Outlook anymore.
