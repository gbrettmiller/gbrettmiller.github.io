Two interesting posts on the question of data ownership, coming from two very different perspectives.

Harold Jarche comes at the question from a &#8220;physical&#8221; standpoint, as he contemplates the closure of Eduspaces, in his post [Own Your Data](http://www.jarche.com/?p=1401 "Harold Jarche - Own Your Data"):

<blockquote title="Harold Jarche - Own Your Data" cite="http://www.jarche.com/?p=1401">
  <p>
    The impending closure of the <a href="http://eduspaces.net/">Eduspaces</a> service has many people wondering what to do and several options are cropping up in the <a href="http://eduspaces.net/mod/vanillaforum/vanilla/comments.php?DiscussionID=52">online discussions</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Anyone who asks me about blogging or setting up a community on the Web using wikis or some other application is given pretty well <a href="http://www.jarche.com/?p=966">the same advice</a>. If the site is important and the data are of some significance for the long term, then:
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      Use an open source platform from a stable and functioning community.
    </li>
    <li>
      Own your own domain, and have a Service Level Agreement for your hosting.
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>
    Using open source gives you freedom from vendors and ensures that you are not handcuffed to your technology provider. Having your own domain name and paying for a service provider (or hosting on your own server) ensure that you have control over your data.

This is one of the reasons I moved this [blog off of Blogger](http://nsl.blogspot.com "...no straight lines...") and onto my own domain . I&#8217;m eventually planning to import that old version onto the new, but I&#8217;ve not been able to get the function to work properly. (An excellent example of what Harold is talking about.)

On the other hand, Ton Zijlstra is thinking more about how to control how the data is used. In [To (Web2.0) Developers: I Want Control of My Data, I Want to Write My Own Rules](http://www.zylstra.org/blog/archives/2007/11/to_web20_develo.html "Ton's Interdependent Thoughts"), he gives developers his two key reasons:

<blockquote title="Ton's Interdependent Thoughts - To (Web2.0) Developers:  I Want Control of My Data, I Want to Write My Own Rules" cite="http://www.zylstra.org/blog/archives/2007/11/to_web20_develo.html">
  <p>
    I sure am with Doc Searls and Dave Winer on this one.<a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/11/23/iWantControlOfMyData.html"> I want control of my own data</a>. And <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/2007/11/25/time-to-write-our-own-rules/">I want to write my own rules</a> on how others may and may not use my data.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    First because if <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tonz/1932426194/">you tell me I have no friends</a> simply because <em>my</em> data is not on <em>your</em> platform, you&#8217;re not getting it. I am the landscape, you are the map. And the map does not get to say what reality is, just what it thinks it looks like.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Second because I want my tools to become smarter, a lot smarter. And it is only me that can provide the context and data that allows tools to be smarter. I need to be in control of my data for you to let your tools be smarter. I need to be the owner of e.g. my favourites/wishlists and preferences for you to really give me good recommendations.

Something to think about.
