From the [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) definition of [tacit knowledge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge) is this short paragraph:

> By definition, tacit knowledge is not easily shared. One of Polanyi&#8217;s famous aphorisms is: &#8220;We know much more than we can tell.&#8221; Tacit knowledge consists often of habits and culture that we do not recognize in ourselves.

In a brief conversation through blog posts and comments, Lilia Efimova and Richard MacManus talk about the &#8220;unfinished&#8221; feeling that goes with blogs and how it affects work on &#8220;finished&#8221; products. A couple of quotes:

> From Lilia in [What if&#8230;](http://blog.mathemagenic.com/2004/12/15.html#a1456):
> 
> Although often I escape into blogging when I don&#8217;t feel like working on a larger, &#8220;finished&#8221; pieces, I guess I really need those pressures to produce something finished to take an extra effort for synthesising &#8220;always unfinished&#8221; into something &#8220;finished&#8221;.
> 
> From Richard in [Weblog Reading And Writing: Always Unfinished?](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/002546.php):
> 
> Having written an article for Digital Web Magazine (and I must get around to writing another one), I can confirm it takes at least a couple of weeks to &#8216;craft&#8217;. Whereas with my weblog, although generally I write carefully crafted long-form posts, it&#8217;s still of-the-moment and a lot of times it&#8217;s an ongoing theme I&#8217;m exploring (ie it&#8217;s not &#8220;finished&#8221;).

As both Lilia and Richard imply, the writing (and reading) of blogs is a way to collect and organize (and reassess as needed) various thoughts and ideas as they are formed and processed. Sounds like tacit knowledge to me.
