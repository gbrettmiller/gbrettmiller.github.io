A quick follow up to [29 Marbles: Autism on 60 Minutes &#8211; 18 Feb 07](http://29marbles.blogspot.com/2007/02/autism-on-60-minutes-18-feb-07.html#links) . My first thoughts after watching the 60 Minutes piece [Diagnosis: Autism](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/02/15/60minutes/main2483414.shtml) on Sunday night was, &#8220;Wow, this was a non-event.&#8221; 

Maybe it&#8217;s just me, and the fact that over the past year I&#8217;ve been soaking in just about every autism story, theory, etc and reading several autism related books, but the show didn&#8217;t seem to shed any new light on anything. 

Of course, if I were the parent of a recently diagnosed child, or (gasp) the parent of a 6-12 month old who wasn&#8217;t responding when I called his name, it would have been a different story. But what exactly would I have learned?
