I love figuring out how things work. In fact, I started blogging mainly because I was interested in the technologies and processes behind it. Not the least part of this was gaining a better understanding of HTML and Style Sheets. I&#8217;ve not really done much on that front since I set up this template here, but a recent article at [plaintxt.org](http://www.plaintxt.org "Minimalism in blogging: an experiment out of control") has got me going again.

    Recently I deleted every post I had on this blog. Why? Because I learned that everything I knew about writing mark-up for my blog was wrong. Not really wrong, actually, but just uninformed.

Scott&#8217;s focus is on [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org "wordpress.org, not wordpress.com"), but I think the basics apply across the board. I share his interest in minimalism in blog design, and expect his advice will come in handy as I work on this blog template in the near future.
