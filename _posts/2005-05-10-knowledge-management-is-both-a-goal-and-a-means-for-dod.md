The May &#8217;05 issue of [Signal Magazine](http://www.afcea.org/signal/) from the [Armed Forces Communications Electronics Association (AFCEA)](http://www.afcea.org) has a large section addressing the role of knowledge management in today&#8217;s Department of Defense. The articles range from discussions of technology used to create a &#8220;net-centric&#8221; force to descriptions of ongoing research into the cognitive workings of teams (that one is my favorite).

If nothing else, the article provides a glimpse at the challenges faced by military forces in collecting, processing, distributing, and using information and knowledge, both from a technical perspective and a &#8220;people&#8221; perspective. Check it out when you have a chance.
