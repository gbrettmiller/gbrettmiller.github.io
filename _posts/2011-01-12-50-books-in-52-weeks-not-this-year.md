I read 45 last year, you can see my [list on GoodReads](http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1852826-brett?shelf=52-in-2010).  As I was getting ready to publicly commit to another year of 50-in-52, though, I realized that I&#8217;m not really ready to move on from the books I read in <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">2011</span> 2010.

It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t want to read anything new, I do. I&#8217;ve got several new books on my list, including David Siteman Garland&#8217;s [**Smarter, Faster, Cheaper**](http://www.smarterfastercheaper.com/ "Smarter, Faster, Cheaper by David Siteman Garland"), Neal Bascomb&#8217;s story of [FIRST](http://www.usfirst.org "For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology") Robotics, [**The New Cool**](http://www.squidoo.com/the-new-cool "The New Cool by Neal Bascomb"), and Hal Needham&#8217;s [**Stuntman!**](http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/books_9780316078993_Description.htm "Stuntman! by Hal Needham") I&#8217;m also looking at some older books that I&#8217;ve never read.

But well over half of the books I read last year are still bouncing around inside my head.

In a [blog post](http://www.jarche.com/2010/10/the-conference-rut/ "The Conference Rut") last October, Harold Jarche  expressed a similar sentiment in the context of conferences that he attends:

> One thing missing in these discrete time-based events is that there is little time for reflection. &#8230; This presentation is followed by some immediate questions & discussions and a coffee break. Then it’s off to see the next presentation. Reflection, if it occurs, comes much later, and usually after the participants have gone home.

Replace &#8220;presentation&#8221; with &#8220;book&#8221;, and that his how I am feeling about the books I read last year.

During a [pre-launch webinar](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/good-ideas-from-steven-johnson/ "Good ideas from Steven Johnson (from Brett's Blog)") for his new book [Where Good Ideas Come From](http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/2010/06/where-good-ideas-come-from.html "Where Good Ideas Come From by Steven Johnson"), Steven Johnson also talked about the state of reading.

> Bill Gates takes a “reading vacation” to read. Ray Ozzie does the same thing. A very interesting strategy; usually when we read it is at night, when we are tired and have 20-30 minutes before we go to bed. Takes a couple of weeks to read, you lose the possible connections between the books you read.

All of this is my overly long way of saying that I&#8217;m not committing to 50-in-52 this year. Instead of moving on to the next conference, in my case a new year of reading only new books, I&#8217;m also going to spend some time quality time reflecting on the books I read last year.

What are your reading plans for 2011?
