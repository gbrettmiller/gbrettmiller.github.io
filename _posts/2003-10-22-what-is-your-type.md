From [Vol 40, No. 4](http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/sj40-4.html) of the [IBM Systems Journal](http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/sj/), a special edition dedicated to Knowledge Management, is **[Views of knowledge are human views](http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/sj/404/dueck.html)** by [Gunter Dueck](http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/sj/404/dueckaut.html#dueck). In the essay, he discusses the different types of knowledge and different &#8220;types&#8221; (in the [Keirseyian](http://www.keirsey.com) sense) of people.

Bottom line, says that when you are working up your KM strategy you need to keep in mind what &#8220;type&#8221; of people are in your organization. More importantly, probably, is that you have to remember that your organization is likely made up of a bunch of different types of people.

In other words, there is no one-size fits all solution for KM.
