  <span class="550021023-08022005"><font face="Arial" size="2">For the past few years, we&#8217;ve had a mixed household of Windows (the primary family computer) and Mac (my son&#8217;s G3 iBook).&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;m a big Mac fan, while my wife has an &#8220;I don&#8217;t care what it is as long as it does what I want it to do&#8221; approach to computers (and technology in general).&nbsp; When the PC finally reached end of life (due to being 5 years old and seemingly permanently infected with Ad/Spy Ware), I convinced her that we really needed a Mac.&nbsp; There are lots of arguments to be made for Mac vs. Windows (which I won&#8217;t go into here), but it came down to:&nbsp; &#8220;Will we have all those pop-ups?&#8221; and &#8220;Will this one last for 5 years?&#8221;</font></span>

  <span class="550021023-08022005"><font face="Arial" size="2">While I was tempted to get the MacMini, when I added up all the other stuff I would need to get to have what I wanted it turned out that the <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/">G5 iMac </a>was really the way to go.&nbsp; Picked up the 20&#8243; at the local (Edison, NJ) Apple Store along with a couple of accessories (Protection Plan, Virtual PC, some blank DVD-R&#8217;s) and took it home to set up.&nbsp; What a joy:</font></span>
</div>

  * <span class="550021023-08022005"><font face="Arial" size="2">Open the box.</font></span>
  * <span class="550021023-08022005"><font face="Arial" size="2">Take the packing material off the top.</font></span>
  * <span class="550021023-08022005"><font face="Arial" size="2">Pull it out of the box.</font></span>
  * <span class="550021023-08022005"><font face="Arial" size="2">Hook up keyboard, mouse to the keyboard, power cable.</font></span>
  * <span class="550021023-08022005"><font face="Arial" size="2">Turn it on.</font></span>

<div>
  <span class="550021023-08022005"><font face="Arial" size="2">It&#8217;s going to be harder than that to disassemble and put away&nbsp;the PC and all the stuff that goes with it.</font></span>

<div>
  <span class="550021023-08022005"><font face="Arial" size="2">To install iLife &#8217;05 (which came as a &#8220;drop-in&#8221; disc set) and Virtual PC I needed to upgrade the RAM.&nbsp; Forgot to get that at Apple Store, but picked it up locally at Circuit City.&nbsp; Installing the RAM chip was a snap, though if my wife had seen me standing over the iMac with the back cover removed she may have freaked out a bit.&nbsp; </font></span>

<div>
  <span class="550021023-08022005"><font face="Arial" size="2">iLife went in without a hitch, as did Virtual PC.&nbsp; I installed both WinXP (for a couple of key apps we have) and Win98 (for the old games that the kids haven&#8217;t been able to use since we upgraded to XP), process was very smooth in both cases.&nbsp; I set up the Windows folders as shares, connected from the iMac and transferred all the key files and data (like the iTunes library).&nbsp; Most tedious part was running the Windows Update.&nbsp; The emulated hardware on the PC side shows up as a 550+ MHz pentium with 265K of RAM.&nbsp; Works better/faster than the PC we replaced.&nbsp; Like getting three computers in one!</font></span>

<div>
  <span class="550021023-08022005"><font face="Arial" size="2">The only real problem I&#8217;ve come across is installation of some OS9 apps in the Classic environment.&nbsp; As far as I can tell, Panther (OS X 10.3.7) doesn&#8217;t support/allow installation&nbsp;and booting from OS9, it only provides &#8220;Classic environment.&#8221;&nbsp; For the most part this is working fine, but a couple of apps haven&#8217;t installed properly because of security access issues.</font></span>
