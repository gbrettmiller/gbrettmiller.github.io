Has autistic intelligence been underestimated through the years? I think many of you know what my answer is going to be (YES! of course), but I actually have a scientific study that backs up that claim that I (and many others) have known all along.

I discovered the study, entitled <span style="font-weight:bold;">The Level and Nature of Autistic Intelligence</span> (available online through the journal [Psychological Science](http://www.psychologicalscience.org/journals/index.cfm?journal=ps&content=ps/18_8), on the [Autism pages](http://autism.about.com/) of [About.com](http://www.about.com/) in the article [Once Again, the World Discovers That People with Autism are Bright but Different](http://autism.about.com/b/a/257904.htm). There is also a discussion of the study on the [Science Daily](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/08/070803151245.htm) website.

The study was written by [Michelle Dawson](http://www.autismcrisis.blogspot.com/), Isabelle SouliÃ¨res, Morton Ann Gernsbacher, and Laurent Mottron. Here&#8217;s the abstract of the paper:

> Autistics are presumed to be characterized by cognitive impairment, and their cognitive strengths (e.g., in Block Design performance) are frequently interpreted as low-level by-products of high-level deficits, not as direct manifestations of intelligence. Recent attempts to identify the neuroanatomical and neurofunctional signature of autism have been positioned on this universal, but untested, assumption. We therefore assessed a broad sample of 38 autistic children on the preeminent test of fluid intelligence, Raven&#8217;s Progressive Matrices. Their scores were, on average, 30 percentile points, and in some cases more than 70 percentile points, higher than their scores on the Wechsler scales of intelligence. Typically developing control children showed no such discrepancy, and a similar contrast was observed when a sample of autistic adults was compared with a sample of nonautistic adults. We conclude that intelligence has been underestimated in autistics.

Unfortunately, you must be a member of the [Association of Psychological Sciences](http://www.psychologicalscience.org/journals/index.cfm) to get the article from their website. Another option, the one I&#8217;m pursuing, is to get a copy from your local public library (or school library, if you are a student). 

I should have it in a couple of weeks, I&#8217;ll post more thoughts once I&#8217;ve actually read it.
