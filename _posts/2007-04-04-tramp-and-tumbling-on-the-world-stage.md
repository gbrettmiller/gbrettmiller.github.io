Last night, NPR aired a [rare piece](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9323358 "NPR:  Soaring Competition: Trampoline World Cup") on World Cup and Olympic Trampoline competition.

<blockquote cite="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9323358" title="NPR All Things Considered:  Soaring Competition:  Trampoline World Cup">
  <p>
    American trampoline artists say their sport sometimes gets tagged as the kind of spectacle that belongs in circuses, not the Olympics. But the sport combines gymnastics and dance — all while mocking gravity at 30 feet in the air.

Short, but [worth a listen](http://www.npr.org/templates/dmg/dmg_wmref.php?prgCode=ATC&showDate=03-Apr-2007&segNum=8&mediaPref=WM&sauid=U419548131143466624515&getUnderwriting=1 "Listen to Soaring Competition: Trampoline World Cup").

This story was inspired in part by the Trampoline and Tumbling World Cup going on this week in [Lake Placid, NY](http://mli.typepad.com/the_cottage_chat/2007/03/another_world_c.html "The Cottage Chat:  Lake Placid's Blog:  Another World Cup Competition in Lake Placid"). A [press release](http://www.usa-gymnastics.org/news/2007/apr02-07tt-worldcupfinals.html "News: Ludvigson and Johnson win bronze medals at Trampoline and Tumbling World Cup") from [USAG](http://www.usa-gymnastics.org "USA Gymnastics home page") yesterday gives the results, including these highlights:

<blockquote cite="http://www.usa-gymnastics.org/news/2007/apr02-07tt-worldcupfinals.html" title="News: Ludvigson and Johnson win bronze medals at Trampoline and Tumbling World Cup">
  <p>
    2006 U.S. tumbling champion <a title="USAG Bio:  Kalon Ludvigson" href="http://www.usa-gymnastics.org/athletes/newbio/athletebios.php?id=368791">Kalon Ludvigson</a> of Cedar Lake, Ind., and 2007 Winter Classic tumbling champion <a title="USAG Bio:  Susannah Johnson" href="http://www.usa-gymnastics.org/athletes/newbio/athletebios.php?id=319585">Susannah Johnson</a> of Roanoke, Va., both won their first World Cup medals when they claimed bronze medals in men’s and women’s tumbling, respectively&#8230;.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Canadian trampolinists set two world records for degree of difficulty at the World Cup. Canada’s <a title="YouTube:  Jason Burnett" href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=jason+burnett&search=Search">Jason Burnett</a> set the mark in men’s trampoline at 17.5, while Rosannagh MacLennan and Karen Cockburn of Canada set a world record at 14.2 in their women’s synchronized trampoline win.
