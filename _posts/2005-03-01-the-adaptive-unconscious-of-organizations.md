I&#8217;ve long had the thought that Knowledge Management is akin to the sub-conscious of an organization, but was never quite happy with the analogy. [Malcolm Gladwell](http://www.gladwell.com)&#8216;s latest book [Blink](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316172324/gbrettmiller-20) discusses the concept of &#8220;adaptive unconscious&#8221; and how it affects us as individuals. 

I can&#8217;t help but think that a similar process is at work in organizations. More to follow&#8230;.
