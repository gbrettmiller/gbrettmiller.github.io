When D&D types win a war like this, however, they don&#8217;t try to erase the perspective of the enemies who once threatened them. They have too much respect for the source material. In the 1980s, angry mobs of parents burned their kids&#8217; D&D books. Those kids, now grown up, digitize and annotate the pamphlets that once condemned them.
