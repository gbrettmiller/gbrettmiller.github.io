Listening to a discussion on a talk radio show yesterday, one of the guests said something to the effect, &#8220;The US is a magnet for steel from everywhere else&#8230;, no pun intended.&#8221; Which got me thinking.

People make these unintended puns because their mind is already thinking of the subject, as in the reference to a magnet in a discussion of the steel industry. In the same way, our everyday decisions &#8211; whether personal, business, or something in between &#8211; are influenced by what we are already thinking of. 

I think we all want to believe that we make objective decisions based on just the information, but we need to keep in mind that all of our decisions are **subjective**, it&#8217;s just that sometimes we don&#8217;t know it.
