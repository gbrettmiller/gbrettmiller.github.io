What would you have done if a prenatal test for autism had existed when you were expecting, and your child had tested positive for autism?  More importantly, what would you do today, knowing what you now know about autism and being an autism parent, if you were expecting and learned that your child would be autistic?  A comment to [my last post](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com/2008/09/prenatal-testing-and-disability-rights/) from [Jen](http://chaosandjoy.blogspot.com/) and [an article from Susan Senator](http://susansenator.com/wantedchild.html) last year give some insight into the question from an autism mom&#8217;s perspective.

[From Jen](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com/2008/09/prenatal-testing-and-disability-rights/#comment-1202):

> I can’t imagine my world without my children in it, but if prenatal testing had been available for autism at that point I probably would have aborted them, as the thought of autistic triplets would not have been one that I could have wrapped my mind around. (needless to say, I was also completely clueless about autism- I think that my two exposures were Rain Man, and an educational aide friend whose wounds I had to fix every night after her “child” with autism bit her all day). I am so glad that I had my children, and as far as I can tell, they are all very happy to be alive. They contribute to the world in so many ways, and we would all be poorer without them.

[From Susan](http://susansenator.com/wantedchild.html):

> I found myself worrying about how many otherwise “lucky” children would now never see the light of day. And what might I — an abortion-rights supporter for so long — have done had there been such a screening for autism, before I knew Nat? Now I shudder to think of it. But given that so much of what you hear in the media involves stories of struggle or horrors like the stabbing at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School, rather than any of the positive potential of autistic people, autism mainly be forever tied to tragedy. I fear what many people might do with information from an autism screening, if it existed.

The theme that comes through from both Jen and Susan is that any decision in this situation is based on information and the mother (and father-) -to-be&#8217;s understanding of what life with autism really means.  Unfortunately, as I&#8217;m finding in [Prenatal Testing and Disability Rights](http://www.amazon.com/Prenatal-Testing-Disability-Hastings-Studies/dp/0878408045/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1222401793&sr=1-1), the people most often in the position to provide the needed information and education (Ob/Gyn&#8217;s and genetic counselors) are quite often the least inclined, and least qualified, to actually provide that information.
