Daryl at the [Anecdote blog](http://www.anecdote.com.au/index.php "Anecdote") recounts a master&#8217;s story from the world of surfing in the post [Letting Go](http://www.anecdote.com.au/archives/2007/11/letting_go.html). In the story, as told by champion surfer  [Kelly Slater](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/kelly%20slater), Slater finds himself in a bad spot following the first (of three) heat of the championship finals and is faced with a choice: try as hard as he can to pull out a miracle; or go out and surf.

Like a true master, Slater chooses the latter and comes away with two perfect rounds. The moral of the story: **Trust your instincts and your training, and don&#8217;t overthink it.**

Anecdote, as Daryl mentions, is a &#8220;blog on business narrative,&#8221; so this post may seem to some to be a bit out of place. But, as Daryl also says, &#8220;there is some important wisdom in this story that is applicable to other areas of life.&#8221;

While the specific process of achieving mastery may depend on what it is we want to master, we can all learn from the experiences of masters in any field.
