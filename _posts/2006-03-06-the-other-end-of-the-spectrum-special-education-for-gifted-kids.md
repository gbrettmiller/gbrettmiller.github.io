In our local paper a couple of weeks ago was the article [Parents, students fear for future of gifted programs](http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/neighborhoods/stories.nsf/news/story/5416DB2406093DA28625711C007201EF?OpenDocument&highlight=2%2C%22gifted%22). In a nutshell, gifted students and their parents are asking for exactly what many parents of autistic kids are trying to avoid- segregation from the regular classroom:

> The resolution notes that gifted students have educational and developmental needs that differ from school populations as a whole, and the board believes gifted students &#8220;require programs or services beyond the level ordinarily provided through the regular school program.&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;I moved to Rockwood due to the gifted programs, which I hope we can keep at their current level,&#8221; parent Karen Smith said. &#8220;The way gifted children learn is so different that they need stimulation and different types of (teaching).&#8221;
> 
> Parent Julie Loos said the gifted program &#8220;prepares my children for real-world solutions.&#8221;

Replace &#8220;gifted&#8221; with &#8220;autistic&#8221; and I think the statements are just as valid. Why, then, do so many parents of autistic kids want to simply put their kids in the mix with the &#8216;normal,&#8217; instead of demanding the &#8220;stimulation and different types of teaching&#8221; that their learning style and abilities demand?

At the same time, programs for the gifted are facing many of the same challenges as &#8216;regular&#8217; special education:

> [They] favor guidelines including a means to monitor qualifications of teachers hired by districts to teach in gifted programs; continuation of certification requirements for gifted teachers; maintaining state guidelines for identifying gifted students; a means to monitor and report the number of students identified by districts as gifted; requiring districts to annually report to the state concerning whether they provide gifted programming and its nature; providing information on gifted programs on districts&#8217; annual report cards; and enhancing the Missouri School Improvement Program standard for gifted programs, so they become more important to the overall accreditation process.

Let the battle for the buck$ begin.
