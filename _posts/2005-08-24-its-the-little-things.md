Life with autism is full of big problems and issues, so the little things sometimes fall by the wayside. For instance, riding a bike &#8211; a two wheeler. But what is bigger to most kids than being able to ride your bike around the neighborhood? If you&#8217;ve ever tried to teach an autistic child to ride a two-wheeler, you know the challenges. They are the same as for other kids, just a bit more difficult. 

I have to admit, we gave up and went with an [adult tricycle](http://brandscycle.com/site/showitem.cfm?Category=144&searchtype=Category&Catalog=39). Not quite the same as a two-wheeler, but Zeke loves it. I think he likes the freedom to get out and ride around, not to mention the wind in his face. We still want to work with him on a two-wheeler, and I think I&#8217;ve found one possible approach at [Lose the Training Wheels](http://www.losethetrainingwheels.org). 

The expressed goals of this web site are fourfold &#8212; to educate all who will listen:

  1. That bike riding can be efficiently and safely taught, 
      * That the universe of people capable of riding bikes is larger and less restrictive than previously realized, 
          * To introduce you to some insights regarding the bicycle that may have escaped your attention up to now, and 
              * To have a little fun with the bicycle as an intellectual challenge. </ol> 
                There is more information in [Adapted Bicycles for Teaching  
                Riding Skills](http://journals.sped.org/tec/articles/Klein37-6.pdf) (.pdf file), published in the July 05 issue of [**Teaching Exceptional Children**](http://journals.sped.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=tec_toc).
                
                For those in the Delaware/Maryland/Virginia area, the 2005 Lower Delaware Autism Foundation Adaptive Bike Camp will be held at Mariner Middle School in Milton Monday, Aug. 29 to Friday, Sept. 2.
