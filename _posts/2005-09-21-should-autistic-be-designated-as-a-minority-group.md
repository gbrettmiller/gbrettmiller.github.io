An interesting article from [Amy Nelson](http://press.xtvworld.com/modules.php?name=Your_Account&op=userinfo&username=AmyNelson), [PressBooth &#8211; Autism Spectrum Conditions a Social Minority Group](http://press.xtvworld.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=6744) raises a very interesting concept for thought and discussion. I have to admit, I&#8217;m not quite sure what I think of it. 

Like all things surrounding autism, how an individual looks at this problem will depend a great deal on how that individual answers the question, &#8220;What is autism?&#8221; I&#8217;m going to have to think on this some more before posting any thoughts on it, but I figured I&#8217;d post this and see what others think.
