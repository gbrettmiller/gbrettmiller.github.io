Here are a couple of stories I&#8217;d like to share on the idea of shared understanding. The first, a conversation between me and my son, Zeke, highlights the importance of being aware of and understanding the context of a situation from different people&#8217;s perspective. The second, a story about a friend of mine, shows the importance of ensuring shared understanding in a shared context and how easy it can be to not have it.

**You know the way home, right?**

My son, Zeke, and I were in Milwaukee for the Midwest Gaming Classic. As we were walking from the hotel to the car getting ready to head home on Sunday morning, Zeke asked me, &#8220;You know the way home, right?&#8221; A reasonable question, and one that I could honestly answer with yes. Which was the right answer, though as it turns out that was not the question he was actually asking.  What Zeke was really asking was, &#8220;Can we listen to the radio on the way home?&#8221;  A little background may be in order.

<img class=" size-full wp-image-13228 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/167.99.231.190/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/map.png?resize=501%2C685" alt="map" width="501" height="685" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/gbrettmiller.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/map.png?w=501 501w, https://i1.wp.com/gbrettmiller.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/map.png?resize=219%2C300 219w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> 

On the drive up to Milwaukee I used Google maps on my phone, connected to the car audio system, as a navigator to get us from home to the hotel. Because I wanted the navigation to come through the audio system, we were limited to listening to music or podcasts (or other apps) from my phone and couldn&#8217;t listen to the radio. So when Zeke asked if I knew the way home, he was really wondering if I needed to use Google maps to get us home. If I had said, &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t know the way&#8221;, then he would have known that we wouldn&#8217;t be able to listen to the radio, and if I said &#8220;Yes&#8221; then we could listen to the radio. (If you&#8217;re wondering, we listened to a couple Premier League soccer matches and the first half of the Cardinals / Braves game.)

Because of our long history (nearly 25 years) together, I knew that he didn&#8217;t care whether or not I knew the way home. He knew that if I didn&#8217;t, I would simply use Google maps as my navigator. I did know that he cares about what we listen to in the car, that he prefers to listen to talk (usually NPR) or sports over music, and that he usually watches Premier League soccer on TV on Sunday mornings. So understanding where he was coming from allowed me to answer the question he was actually wanting an answer for. It&#8217;s probably worth noting at this point that Zeke is autistic and, while able to communicate verbally, has some unique challenges and methods in his communications. Developing this shared understanding has been critical for both of us to understand each other.

**DO NOT LET GO, YOU ARE NOT ON BELAY!**

Some friends were out rock climbing. It was an especially nice weekend, so there were a lot of people out taking advantage. There was one route my friends wanted to attempt so they waited while another pair were climbing. While most of my group of friends were relaxing and just generally hanging out, one friend &#8211; we&#8217;ll call him Dave &#8211; was watching the other pair climb. And good thing he was.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13232" src="https://i0.wp.com/167.99.231.190/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nwahcr.jpg?resize=640%2C118" alt="nwaHCR" width="640" height="118" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/gbrettmiller.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nwahcr.jpg?w=1228 1228w, https://i2.wp.com/gbrettmiller.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nwahcr.jpg?resize=300%2C55 300w, https://i2.wp.com/gbrettmiller.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nwahcr.jpg?resize=768%2C141 768w, https://i2.wp.com/gbrettmiller.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nwahcr.jpg?resize=1024%2C188 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/gbrettmiller.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nwahcr.jpg?resize=640%2C118 640w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> 

When a climber reaches the top of a route on lead, he will typically clip directly into the anchors and go off belay so that he can fix a rappel to get back down. Sometimes, though, he will set some gear and run the rope through the gear so he can be lowered down and the next climber can then top rope the route. In this case, the climber did neither; instead, he down climbed to the last piece of protection he had placed on the way up, apparently with the expectation that his belayer would then lower him from that point. The belayer, however, was not aware of any of this, having expected that the climber had gone off belay at the anchor. (I think you can see where this is going.)

Dave, my friend, was watching all of this and saw that 1) the belayer had taken the climber off belay and 2) the climber was getting ready to let go of the rock and lean back to be lowered to the ground, which meant that 3) the climber was just about to plunge to his death. At which point Dave shouted at the top of his lungs, &#8220;DO NOT LET GO, YOU ARE NOT ON BELAY!

The route this pair was climbing was an overhanging 5.11c, meaning that this was an experienced pair of climbers (5.11c is hard) and that when the climber is on the top half of the route the climber and belayer cannot see each other. The typical exchange when the climber gets to the top and clips into the anchor would be for the climber to shout down, &#8220;Off belay&#8221; (to let the belayer know that they can take him off belay) and the belayer shouting back up, &#8220;Belay is off&#8221; to make sure that the climber knows he is on his own. In this case, the climber shouted something down, the belayer thought it was &#8220;Off belay&#8221;.  The pair thought they had a shared understanding of the situation, but they obviously did not. The climber had broken from the routine, while the belayer was following the routine because she didn&#8217;t know of the climber&#8217;s change.

Fortunately for this pair, and everyone at the crag that day, Dave&#8217;s warning was in time and successful in stopping the climber from letting go and leaning back.

**The point?**

There is no real definition of what &#8220;shared understanding&#8221; entails; it&#8217;s more of a &#8220;know it when you see it&#8221; kind of thing. These two stories, hopefully, show what shared understanding might mean in different situations; one being a situation where two people are coming from a different context and one where they are coming from the same context.

Would love to hear some of your stories about shared understanding, or the lack thereof.
