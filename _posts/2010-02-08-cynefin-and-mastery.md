When I first discovered the [Cynefin framework](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cynefin), I remember thinking, &#8220;Exactly.&#8221; It is one of those things that once I saw it I realized how obvious it was, at least in hindsight after someone had pointed it out. Of course, I&#8217;ve been trying to actually figure it out ever since.

[Dave Snowden blogged recently](http://www.cognitive-edge.com/blogs/dave/2010/02/evolution_of_cynefin_over_a_de.php) that he is putting together a history of Cynefin, and provides a brief timeline of its origins and where it is now. He also includes a diagram showing the diagram as it was in 2000 compared to what it is now:

[<img class="alignnone" title="Cynefin - Then and Now" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.cognitive-edge.com/blogs/dave/Screen%20shot%202010-02-07%20at%2013.35.27.png?resize=600%2C316" alt="" width="600" height="316" data-recalc-dims="1" />](http://www.cognitive-edge.com/blogs/dave/2010/02/evolution_of_cynefin_over_a_de.php#more)

My most [recent post that included Cynefin](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/cynefin-concept-work-and-the-role-of-deliberate-practice/) looked at it in the context of  concept work and the role of [deliberate practice](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/tag/deliberatepractice/) in achieving [mastery](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/category/mastery/). The basic premise of that post was that success in the chaotic domain requires mastery, which is the result of a lot (10,000 + hours) of deliberate practice. Even though originally developed with a focus on knowledge management and communities of practice, the origins of the model, as shown above, seem to lend some validity to my understanding.

An added bonus to Dave&#8217;s blog post is the comment from [Steve Barth](http://reflexions.typepad.com/) (the emphasis is mine):

> Something I’ve been thinking about lately relates to the original knowledge-training axis in the early drawings. It comes up working with clients to differentiate and merge knowledge management and organizational learning programs. Increasingly, I believe tha**t knowledge and learning are often polar opposites**, and the order/unorder sides of the model make this clear. **Simple and complicated** **emphasize what we** _**already know**_—or at least believe to be true—and further investigations and analysis must either accept or falsify these premises. We assume that our assumptions are correct. On the other hand, **learning is largely about what we** _**don’t know**_. That is, we must assume that our assumptions could be wrong.

I&#8217;m looking forward to the full history.
