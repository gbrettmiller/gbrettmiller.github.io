<span style="font-style:italic;">Not that long ago, Kev Leitch converted his <a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/">Left Brain / Right Brain</a> blog into a team blog. I had been considering shutting down 29 Marbles and stopping blogging, but decided to take Kev up on his offer. That way, I could continue to post very intermittently without feeling the pressure of trying to keep a site up on my own.<br /></span>

<span style="font-style:italic;">Unfortunately, Kev has since shut down the blog (as you will see if you click the link above to LB/RB). To maintain some continuity and a record of my posts, I&#8217;ve decided to republish them here. This is the first of four posts I published at LB/RB.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic;">&#8211; &#8211; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212;&#8211;</span>

Earlier this summer I read [Douglas Hofstadter](http://www.cogs.indiana.edu/people/homepages/hofstadter.html "Indiana University - Douglas Hofstadter")&#8216;s new book, **[I Am a Strange Loop](http://www.amazon.com/Am-Strange-Loop-Douglas-Hofstadter/dp/0465030785 "amazon.com:  I Am a Strange Loop")**. As Hofstadter mentions early in the book, a more appropriate title would have been **&#8220;I&#8221; is a Strange Loop**; the book is about the nature of consciousness, that elusive concept of &#8220;I&#8221;, and not an autobiographical work as the actual name of the book suggests.

Hofstadter&#8217;s works have been among my favorites since I read his first book, [Godel Escher Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid](http://www.amazon.com/Godel-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-0173149-4649552?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1190380285&sr=1-1 "amazon.com:  Godel, Escher, Bach"), in high school. The new book is, in fact, an updating of the ideas he first expressed in GEB. I have long hoped that he might address issues of the mind and consciousness in terms of atypical minds (such as autism), but aside from some passing discussion of those minds, I Am a Strange Loop does not provide any real insight into how the concept of &#8220;I&#8221; fits with autism.

On Monday, I was pleased to find a paper that specifically addresses the question of autism and &#8220;I&#8221;, [Self-Referential Cognition and Empathy in Autism](http://www.scientistlive.com/18810/selfreferential-cognition-and-empathy-in-autism.thtml), co-authored by Michael V. Lombardo, Jennifer L. Barnes, Sally J. Wheelwright, and Simon Baron-Cohen. From the paper&#8217;s abstract:

<blockquote cite="http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchObjectAttachment.action?representation=PDF&uri=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0000883">
  <p>
    <b>Background</b>. Individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) have profound impairments in the interpersonal social domain, but it is unclear if individuals with ASC also have impairments in the intrapersonal self-referential domain. We aimed to evaluate across several well validated measures in both domains, whether both self-referential cognition and empathy are impaired in ASC and whether these two domains are related to each other.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b> Conclusions/Significance</b>. We conclude that individuals with ASC have broad impairments in both self-referential cognition and empathy. These two domains are also intrinsically linked and support predictions made by simulation theory. Our results also highlight a specific dysfunction in ASC within cortical midlines structures of the brain such as the medial prefrontal cortex.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Instead of looking at autism as a syndrome of self-focus (the Kanner approach), the paper starts from the concept of &#8220;absent-self&#8221; put forth by [Uta Frith](http://www.icn.ucl.ac.uk/Staff-Lists/MemberDetails.php?Title=Prof&FirstName=Uta&LastName=Frith "Professor Uta Frith") in her book [Autism: Explaining the Enigma](http://www.amazon.com/Autism-Explaining-enigma-Cognitive-development/dp/0631158332 "amazon.com: Autism - Explaining the Enigma"). I had not heard of Frith before reading this paper, so I can&#8217;t really comment on her ideas. But the paper itself seems to make sense. I&#8217;m still going through it, trying to understand all that they are studying and what their results mean. (I did learn a new word: [alexithymia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexithymia "alexithymia") &#8211; difficulty identifying and describing one&#8217;s own emotions.)

My first time through **I Am a Strange Loop** was to soak in the big concepts. I typically wait a few months before re-reading something like this so I can get into the details, but I think I&#8217;ll start again sooner than that. (At the moment, I&#8217;m reading [Steven Pinker](http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/about/index.html "Steven Pinker - About")&#8216;s latest book [The Stuff of Thought](http://www.amazon.com/Stuff-Thought-Language-Window-Nature/dp/0670063274 "amazon.com: The Stuff of Thought").) Now that I have a bit more information about autism and &#8220;I&#8221;, I&#8217;ll have a better context for processing what I read.

Another interesting note about the paper, it was originally published by the [Public Library of Science](http://www.plosone.org/home.action "Publishing science, accelerating research") under a Creative Commons license. The PLoS home page describes it as a &#8220;A new way of communicating peer-reviewed science and medicine&#8221;, so I will assume the paper has been appropriately peer reviewed. But I think I will do a bit more checking just to be sure. (Of course, any insight from readers here would be greatly appreciated.)
