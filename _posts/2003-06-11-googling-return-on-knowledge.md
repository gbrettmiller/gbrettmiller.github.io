I figured the best way to start finding out about **ROK** was to [Google](http://www.google.com) it. The search on [&#8220;Return on Knowledge&#8221;](http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=%22RETURN+ON+KNOWLEDGE%22) returned about 869 results, the top ones being such things as:

The list goes on and on and on&#8230;.
