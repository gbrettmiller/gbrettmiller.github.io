Can you really **know** something if you didn&#8217;t **learn** it?

I was sitting in a meeting the other day in which a group of engineers was giving a presentation on some analysis of a system they are working on. The slides were well done and had a lot of &#8220;information&#8221; on them. As I was looking at the slides later, I realized that I could easily digest and retain the **explicit** knowledge that the slides represented, but that I had absolutely no idea of the [**tacit** knowledge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge) that was created by the engineers in the process of preparing this presentation.

I&#8217;ve long considered explicit knowledge to be not much more than **information** (at least from an individual perspective). The content of these slides is, to me, information that I can use to further develop my own knowledge of the content. If you were to ask me a question about the system, I could tell you the information that was on the slides. I might, if I had good notes and recall that day, be able to tell you a little bit about how the information was derived.

I would &#8220;know&#8221; the information, but would I really know anything &#8220;about&#8221; the information?

Some similar thoughts from Frank Patrick in [It&#8217;s More Than the Numbers](http://www.focusedperformance.com/2004_12_01_blarch.html#10876551351590285):

> It&#8217;s the logical analysis of situations &#8212; the understanding of cause-and-effect that results in what the numbers are saying &#8212; that lead to &#8220;improved business decisions.&#8221; &#8230; What helps round out the sufficiency is the application of <span style="font-weight:bold;">logical analysis</span> to provide a <span style="font-weight:bold;">context </span>for the quantitative analysis. You can&#8217;t run a business &#8220;by the numbers&#8221; alone.

_Update:_

Saw [Practical Wisdom](http://denham.typepad.com/km/2004/12/practical_wisdo.html) this morning. Denham discusses the new book [**Deep Smarts**](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591395283/gbrettmiller-20) in which the authors &#8220;explore the cognitive and competency practices that enable swift decisions, explain master level experience and examine ways to transfer these exceptional skills.&#8221;
