I&#8217;ve been catching up on the posts over at [Work Literacy](http://www.workliteracy.com) (that&#8217;s a lot of catching up!), along with discovering new (to me) blogs in the field of learning. This in turn has had me revisiting old posts and ideas of my own.

Joan Vinall-Cox&#8217;s post [Old Skills and New Know-How](http://joanvinallcox.wordpress.com/2008/06/24/old-skills-new-know-how/), a response to Michele Martin&#8217;s post [Knowledge Workers as Craft Workers](http://www.workliteracy.com/knowledge-workers-as-craft-workers) (which, as it turns out, is based on a [comment I left](http://www.workliteracy.com/developing-work-literacies-whos-the-target-audience#comment-250) to another of Michele&#8217;s posts), discusses the importance of understanding the skills that must go into using a new technology.

Re-printed below is a post of mine from August 2006, [Tools do not a master make](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/2006/tools-do-not-a-master-make), that explores a similar theme.

<div class="post-entry">
  <p>
    No tool of modern technology is as universally used, and almost as universally reviled, in the world of business and government as is <a title="Microsoft Office Online: PowerPoint 2003 Home Page" href="http://www.microsoft.com/powerpoint">Microsoft PowerPoint</a>. Perhaps most famous of the PowerPoint bashers is <a title="The Work of Edward Tufte and Graphics Press" href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/index">Edward Tufte</a>, writer of several books and essays on information design. (I was fortunate enough to attend one of <a title="Edward Tufte: Courses" href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/courses">his courses</a> in the late ’90s, his <a title="Edward Tufte: Posters" href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/posters">poster of Napoleon’s March to Moscow</a> still hangs on the wall in my office.)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Tufte has described his issues with PowerPoint in magazine articles (such as <a title="Tufte - PowerPoint is Evil (wired.com  Sep 2003)" href="http://wired.com/wired/archive/11.09/ppt2.html">PowerPoint is Evil</a> in <a title="Wired.com" href="http://wired.com/">Wired</a> magazine), in a self-published essay entitled <a title="Edward Tufte - The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint" href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/powerpoint">The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint</a>, and in a chapter in his latest book <a title="Edward Tufte - Beautiful Evidence" href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_be">Beautiful Evidence</a>. In the past week or so a few others have also lambasted PowerPoint, including Dave Snowden of <a title="Cognitive Edge" href="http://www.cognitive-edge.com/">Cognitive Edge</a> in a couple of posts (<a title="Dave Snowden - Festival of Bureaucratic Hyper-Rationalism" href="http://www.cognitive-edge.com/2006/08/festival_of_bureaucratic_hyper.php">Festival of Bureaucratic Hyper-Rationalism</a> and <a title="Dave Snowden - Tufte and PowerPoint" href="http://www.cognitive-edge.com/2006/08/tufte_and_powerpoint.php">Tufte and PowerPoint</a>) and Scott Adams (via <a title="Dilbert - 04 August 2006" href="http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/archive/dilbert-20060804.html">Dilbert</a>).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a title="Don Norman's jnd.org / press kit / biography" href="http://www.jnd.org/bio-sketch.html">Don Norman</a>, of the <a title="Nielsen Norman Group: usability consulting, training & user research reports" href="http://nngroup.com/">Nielsen Norman Group</a>, has a different take on PowerPoint. In his essay <a title="Don Norman's jnd.org / In Defense of PowerPoint" href="http://jnd.org/dn.mss/in_defense_of_powerp.html">In Defense of PowerPoint</a>, Norman places the blame not on PowerPoint but on those who use it improperly. “Don’t blame the problem on the tool.” Or, put another way &#8211; <a title="Google search results" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22Powerpoint+doesn%27t+bore+people%2C+people+bore+people%22&btnG=Google+Search">PowerPoint doesn’t bore people, people bore people</a>. <a title="About Cliff Atkinson" href="http://sociablemedia.typepad.com/about.html">Cliff Atkinson</a> is another who believes that PowerPoint can be used effectively. For some great ideas check out the <a title="beyond bullets" href="http://www.beyondbullets.com/">Beyond Bullets</a> blog or Atkinson’s book <a title="amazon.com - Beyond Bullet Points: Using Microsoft PowerPoint to Create Presentations That Inform, Motivate, and Inspire" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735620520/sociablemedia-20">Beyond Bullet Points</a>.

    Of course, this problem is not limited to the world of business. One of the big promises of ever faster and more powerful consumer technology (if we are to believe marketing campaigns) is that everyone will be able to perform like an expert. Take, for example, the following pitch for Apple’s GarageBand software (emphasis is mine):
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The new video track in GarageBand makes it easy to add an original music score to your movies. And don’t worry about your musical talent — <strong><em>or lack thereof</em></strong>. Just use GarageBand’s included loops, or try a combination of loops, software instruments, or any previous audio recordings you created.
    </p>
    
    <div class="source">
      — <a title="Go to http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/" href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/">Apple &#8211; iLife &#8211; Garageband</a>
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    Don’t get me wrong, I love GarageBand (and the whole <a title="Apple - iLife" href="http://www.apple.com/iLife">iLife</a> suite for that matter, I use it almost every day). It is very easy to create a ’song’ using loops, like my <a id="p21" title="First Song.mp3 - Brett Miller's first song in GarageBand" href="../wp-content/uploads/2006/08/First%20Song.mp3">First Song</a>. Once I got comfortable with the GarageBand interface, it only took me a couple of hours to browse through the loops, pull some together so it sounded good, and export it to iTunes. The ’song’ is listenable, but doesn’t reflect any real musical skill on my part. I didn’t apply any knowledge of time signatures, keys, tempo, or anything. I just dragged-and-dropped.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I guess my point is don’t get pulled into a false belief that a tool, any tool, can make you an expert at something or give you expert results. Remember, good tools are nice to have, but in the hands of a master even the simplest of tools can create wonders.
