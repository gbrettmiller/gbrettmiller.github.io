[The Cincinnati Post &#8211; Noah, for one, is peeling back the layers of autism](http://news.cincypost.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050507/LIFE02/505070319/1007/LIFE) gives one mother&#8217;s example of why you should never give up hope: 

> Terri says Noah is emerging from autism. The official word from the medical establishment on autism is that there&#8217;s no cure. But Terri says the establishment is wrong. She insists Noah is coming back to her, getting better. His drawings suggest she&#8217;s right.

A fairly long article by online newspaper standards, but lots of good information. 

I also heartily recommend reading [Unraveling the Mystery of Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorder : A Mother&#8217;s Story of Research & Recovery](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/0767907981&link_code=as2&camp=1789&tag=gbrettmiller-20&creative=9325) by Karyn Seroussi. Excellent insights into the effect of diet on autism.
