Mike Stanton&#8217;s post [Of mice and men and autistic fruit flies](http://mikestanton.wordpress.com/2007/09/06/of-mice-and-men-and-autistic-fruit-flies/) includes the following criticism of an autism related study using fruit flies:

> But autistic fruit flies? Autism is a complex social disorder. Fruit flies are not complex social beings.

My first thought was, if autism is a &#8220;complex social disorder&#8221; it is only because we live in a complex social environment. In the comments, Amanda disagrees with Mike that autism is a social disorder at all, and I think I agree with her.

True, autism is measured against the &#8220;norms&#8221; of the complex social environment in which we live, but the &#8220;condition&#8221; of autism exists independently of those norms. If those norms didn&#8217;t exist, or if our social environment was different, those who are autistic in our world would still be autistic in this alternate world. 

Mike&#8217;s commentary also includes a passage with which [I wholeheartedly agree](http://29marbles.blogspot.com/2005/03/unreasonable-man.html):

> They showed diminished social interaction but improved cognitive performance compared to neurotypical mice. This is automatically seen as a deficit. But surely progress is driven by those individuals who turn their back on the herd and consider the external world?

<span style="font-style:italic;">Kristina Chew also has some thoughts on the studies, and Mike&#8217;s post, in her post <a href="http://www.autismvox.com/can-animals-have-autism/">Can Animals Have Autism?</a></span>
