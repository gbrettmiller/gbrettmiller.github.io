Video games like the [Guitar Hero](http://www.guitarhero.com "Guitar Hero community") franchise and the recently released [Rock Band](http://www.rockband.com "Rock Band") give gamers a chance to become &#8220;musicians&#8221;, if only in pretend. It was by happy accident (thanks to shuffle mode in iTunes) that I heard a discussion yesterday with NPR [music blogger Carrie Brownstein](http://www.npr.org/blogs/monitormix/ "NPR:  Monitor Mix") on an (unfortunately unknown to me) NPR program on the subject.

The discussion centered on what Carrie had written in the post [Are We Not Gamers?](http://www.npr.org/blogs/monitormix/2007/11/are_we_not_gamers.html "Are We Not Gamers?  (NPR: Monitor Mix)"), which in turn derived from a [review of Rock Band](http://www.slate.com/id/2177432 "Sleater-Kinney's guitarist tests out tRock Band") that Carrie wrote for [Slate.com](http://www.slate.com "Slate.com").

  <p>
    The line between gamers and non-gamers is clearly diminishing, if not already obsolete&#8230;. The best and newest games, such as Rock Band, meld the virtual with the actual; they make little distinction between what is palpable and what is imagined. With Rock Band, you are hanging out with your very real friends, playing along to the master recordings of real songs, and on screen you are atop some of the biggest stages in the world.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Of course, the truth is that you are nowhere except in front of your TV. But Rock Band professes that it doesn&#8217;t matter&#8211;though you might not be creating memorable music with your friends, you are creating a memorable, real-life moment, all with the help of the unreal.

I likely would not have written anything here about that discussion (or the blog or the review), except for something that happened to me on Monday night. On that night, I attended a parent&#8217;s meeting for my son&#8217;s high school band (he&#8217;s a percussionist) at which a local music store salesman presented [SmartMusic](http://www.smartmusic.com/ "SmartMusic educational software for music teachers and students").

My first thoughts (I hesitate to say) as he went through the demo were along the lines of, &#8220;This is a lot like Guitar Hero, except with real instruments.&#8221; To say that I was impressed with the system would be an understatement. Of course, it could have just been good salesmanship by the rep, but I don&#8217;t think so. Here&#8217;s the basic description of [SmartMusic](http://www.smartmusic.com/ "SmartMusic educational software for music teachers and students") in their words:

<blockquote cite="http://www.smartmusic.com/students/default.aspx?page=page2_1" title="SmartMusic: What is SmartMusic?">
  <p>
    Students never practice alone when they have SmartMusic at home. This interactive, computer-based practice system helps students get better faster, and makes practicing more fun. With amazing accompaniments for more than 30,000 titles, challenging exercises, and the ability to record personal CDs, SmartMusic is the future of music learning.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    With SmartMusic loaded on a computer, students plug in a vocal or instrumental microphone and begin practicing. They play or sing their part with accompaniment and receive, in real time on the computer, detailed feedback on their performance. Ideal for woodwind, brass, string, and vocal musicians of all levels.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    SmartMusic is your instant backup band that <a id="Page2_11_link2_1_1" href="http://www.smartmusic.com/students/default.aspx?page=page2_1_1">makes practicing fun!</a>

If you remember [Marc Prensky](http://www.marcprensky.com/experience/Prensky-Bio.pdf "(.pdf) Marc Prensky Bio")&#8216;s [12 reasons games engage us](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/2007/video-games-future-of-education-or-harmful-addiction-part-2-of-3 "NSL: Video games: Future of education or harmful addiction (part 2 of 3)"), [SmartMusic](http://www.smartmusic.com/ "SmartMusic educational software for music teachers and students") seems to meet all but the last one. Basically, they&#8217;ve taken the things that make learning in video games fun and applied them to learning in real life.
