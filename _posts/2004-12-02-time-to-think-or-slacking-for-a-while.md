The past couple of months have been nothing if not interesting (and busy busy busy). Though I&#8217;ve continued to read (and make the occasional comment to) many of my favorite blogs, I&#8217;ve not posted anything new of my own. At first, I was just too busy to do anything (read or write). As more time became available, I focused on reading just to keep up. When I was at a point where I **could** start writing again, I decided that I **didn&#8217;t want to**. At least not right away. 

It&#8217;s not that I didn&#8217;t want to contribute any more, or that I didn&#8217;t think I had anything to contribute. In fact, the number of people subscribed to this blog in Bloglines actually went up by 2 or 3 (up to a whopping 12) in the time I didn&#8217;t post. Basically, when I looked back on what I had done with the benefit of a month away, I realized that I wasn&#8217;t really happy with how I was going about things.

This blog, [&#8230;no straight lines&#8230;](http://nsl.blogspot.com/), was the first and main blog that I started. It had a rough go of it in the beginning, but then it picked up. The focus was kind of Knowledge Management, but in fact it wasn&#8217;t really focused at all. Because I&#8217;m using Blogger/Blogspot, I don&#8217;t have the ability to categorize posts, so after a while I created two more blogs, [Thinking in Bits](http://thinkinginbits.blogspot.com/) &#8211; focused on technology &#8211; and [State of Education](http://stateofeducation.blogspot.com/), which addressed the application of KM and technology in the academic arena. 

On the reading side, I quickly found (as Lilia warned me) that I had bitten off more than I&#8217;d ever be able to chew in terms of reading of blogs in all these areas. My BlogLines subscriptions were going crazy.

So I decided to step back, take a deep breath, and relax. Think about what I really want to accomplish. Figure out the best way to do it. And accept the fact that I can&#8217;t have/do everything. As Dean Kaman once remarked when asked if he felt bad about missing out on things like popular culture (when asked if he knew who Tom Cruise was, he responded, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t he an actor or something?&#8221;) &#8212; **Everyone is missing something**.

So here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve done: Stopped working on **Thinking in Bits** and **State of Education**. Accepted that **&#8230;no straight lines&#8230;** is unfocused and rejoice in the relative chaos &#8211; this will truly be my **Digital Waste Book**. And finally, create a new blog that is, by design, focused.

The new blog is called [4 Big Dogs](http://4bigdogs.blogspot.com/). Originally I had though to focus it on Knowledge Management, but after some thought realized that KM is really just one part, one tool in the toolbox, of what I&#8217;m really interested in &#8211; Individual and Organizational Performance Improvement. Of course, saying you are going to &#8220;focus&#8221; on an area this broad is akin to not focusing on anything at all. But my intent is to not post anything there that doesn&#8217;t contribute directly to a better understanding of performance improvement.

Thanks to the many people out there that have so many different types of blogs and approaches to blogs that I could look at and study as I tried to figure out where I wanted to go with mine. It is all a work in progress, and I don&#8217;t expect that it will ever be completed. But that&#8217;s what makes it so much fun.
