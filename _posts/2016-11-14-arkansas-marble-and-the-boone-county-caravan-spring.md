In the aftermath (afterglow?) of the recent US elections I&#8217;ve been giving some thought to discussions about rural America that have been bouncing around. I drove through quite a bit of this ruralness on my way to Horseshoe Canyon Ranch this past weekend for a climbing trip with friends. Don&#8217;t worry, I didn&#8217;t think too much about all this while we climbing. But we did have some good conversation around the campfire.

On my drive home from the Ranch yesterday I decided to stop at a couple of historical markers along Highway 7. I&#8217;ve driven this road several times, and have seen the signs for the markers, but had never stopped before. Here&#8217;s what I found.

**Arkansas Marble**

> This marker commemorates the Arkansas marble in Washington&#8217;s Monument, taken by Beller and Harp bros. from this hill in 1836. This marker erected in 1954 by Newton Co. History Society.   W.F. Lackey Pres, Manda Hickman Sec.

A quick Google search ([Arkansas marble Washington Monument](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=arkansas+marble+washington+monument)) returned some great sites and information about the stone, the Washington Monument, and even the roadside marker itself.

**Boone County Caravan Spring**

The other marker at which I stopped on my journey was a commemoration of a much less successful journey from the mid 19th century.

> Near this spring, in September 1857, gathered a caravan of 150 men, women and children, who here began the ill-fated journey to California. The entire party, with the exception of seventeen small children, was massacred at Mountain Meadows, Utah, by a body of Mormons disguised as Indians.

A(nother) quick Google search ([Boone County Caravan Spring](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=boone%20county%20caravan%20spring)) pulled back this treasure trove of [Mountain Meadows Massacre Historical Accounts](http://www.legendsofamerica.com/ut-mountainmeadowshistoricaccounts.html), among other great resources.

**The point**

I came across these two markers, commemorating the actions of people just a couple of miles, and a couple of years, apart in what many people would call &#8220;the middle of nowhere&#8221;.  No real point here except a reminder that there is a lot of history all around us in this big wide country of ours. Not all of it makes it into the history books, but it is all a part of how we got to where we are, and where we are going.
