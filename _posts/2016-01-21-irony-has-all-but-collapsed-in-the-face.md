Irony has all but collapsed in the face of absurdity; even as science becomes day-to-day business, ignorance won&#8217;t stop screaming as it realizes it can only survive as the willful kind. People are fracturing into xenophobic tribes, in fear of the infinite information that breaks down certainty and complacency.
