I don&#8217;t have a lot of details, but heard this in the local headlines on [KWMU](http://www.kwmu.org) this morning. Just a couple of links on [Google News](http://news.google.com/news?source=ig&hl=en&um=1&tab=wn&q=Missouri+Commission+on+Autism&btnG=Search+News), I expect more over the next few days (weeks)? From the [Joplin Globe](http://www.joplinglobe.com/joplin_metro/local_story_175204612.html?start:int=0):

> <span><span><span>A statewide commission on autism spectrum disorders will be assembled and, by July 1 of next year, will produce a plan for Missouri to offer treatment, training and other services.</span></span></span>
> 
> [&#8230;]
> 
> <span><span><span>The commission will be made up of representatives from the General Assembly, health-related state agencies and autism-related organizations, and parents. Kinder was filling in for Gov. Matt Blunt, who is out of state.</span></span></span>
> 
> [&#8230;]
> 
> <span><span><span>Kinder spokesman Gary McElyea said members of the state commission should be chosen fairly quickly.</span></span></span>

As you might imagine, there is a lot of disagreement about what exactly the commission should do, what should be its priorities, blah blah. I applaud the gesture, and the intent, of the commission, but I&#8217;ll withhold any real assessment until I see what they actually plan to do.
