Solving a problem that you know has a solution may require knowledge, but it is knowledge that already exists. Unfortunately &#8211; or, if you prefer, fortunately &#8211; many of the problems that are worth solving, that need to be solved, don&#8217;t come with that level of certainty.

In his book, [How Life Imitates Chess](http://www.amazon.com/How-Life-Imitates-Chess-Boardroom/dp/1596913886/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1357624663&sr=1-1&keywords=how+life+imitates+chess "Amazon link (non-affiliate)") (which, by the way, I highly recommend), Garry Kasparov has this to say about uncertainty:

> Knowing a solution is at hand is a huge advantage; it’s like not having a “none of the above” option. Anyone with reasonable competence and adequate resources can solve a puzzle when it is presented as something to be solved. We can skip the subtle evaluations and move directly to plugging in possible solutions until we hit upon a promising one. Uncertainty is far more challenging. Instead of immediately looking for solutions to the crisis, we have to maintain a constant state of asking, “Is there a crisis* forming?”
