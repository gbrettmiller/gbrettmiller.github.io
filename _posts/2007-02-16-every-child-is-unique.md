Yesterday, [abfh wrote something](http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2007/02/joy-is-only-beginning.html) that captures perfectly how I feel about being a parent &#8211; not just of an autistic son, but of both my kids (emphasis is mine):

> Children are <span style="font-weight:bold;">always different from their parents</span> and from one another in a great many ways, and <span style="font-weight:bold;">each child is uncharted territory</span>. No one ever knows how well they can deal with parenting any child. It&#8217;s always a matter of <span style="font-weight:bold;">gaining experience on the job</span>, observing how the child grows and learns, and loving the child enough to <span style="font-weight:bold;">let the natural process of growth</span> take place, <span style="font-weight:bold;">unconstrained by the parents&#8217; needs and assumptions</span>.

This has now found a place in my trusty notebook of things I want to have handy. If anyone asks me how I &#8220;deal&#8221; with parenting an autistic child, I&#8217;ll simply show them this.
