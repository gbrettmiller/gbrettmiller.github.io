When I saw the first <a HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000K19E/gbrettmiller-20">Matrix</a> movie, I remember thinking of the distinctions between explicit and tacit knowledge. If you remember the scene with the helicopter, you know what I mean. The &#8220;knowledge&#8221; of how to fly a helicopter was made explicit in the form of a computer program/disk. When a person needed the knowledge so they could actually fly the helicopter, the &#8220;explicit&#8221; knowledge was downloaded into the person&#8217;s brain (mind?) and became &#8220;tacit&#8221;. Though this is probably a good jumping off point for a discussion of explicit vs. tacit knowledge and how to manage the two (if you can), what I really want to address is something I noticed while recently watching the second of the series, <a HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AXE8I/gbrettmiller-20">The Matrix Reloaded</a>.

During one of the fight scenes, Neo (played by Keanu Reeves) is fighting against several &#8220;bad guys&#8221; at a chateau in the mountains. I know that the actors went through a lot of training to prepare for these fight scenes, but watching this particular scene I couldn&#8217;t help noticing that Keanu Reeves seemed stiff as he was fighting, and that the moves were choreographed. 

Of course the moves were choreographed, but I guess that&#8217;s my point. The fight choreographers developed the fight scenes, then made the &#8220;knowledge&#8221; of the fight (in this case the choreography) explicit so the actors could &#8220;learn&#8221; the fight. But, and here is the important part, the actors did not learn &#8220;how to fight&#8221; but rather &#8220;how to perform the fight&#8221; for the film. They were acting on explicit knowledge, but it never really became &#8220;tacit.&#8221;

On the other hand, the stunt men portraying the bad guys obviously had the tacit knowledge of how to fight &#8211; you can see it in how they carry themselves and the weapons. For them, it was a matter of taking the new choreography and incorporating it into what they already knew.
