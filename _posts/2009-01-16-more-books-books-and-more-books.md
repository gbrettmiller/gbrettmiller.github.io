Back in November &#8217;07 I signed up for [Shelfari](http://www.shelfari.com), the self-described &#8220;premier social network for people who love books.&#8221;  Up till that point I had been keeping a book list in my handy-dandy notebook (I&#8217;m still a bit low-tech in some areas).  This was about the time I was jumping into the world of social media beyond the blog, so it seemed a reasonable thing to transfer my [book list onto Shelfari](http://www.shelfari.com/gbrettmiller "my book list on Shelfari.com").  I spent a bit of time getting used to the interface, and then started plugging in my books.  I also used Shelfari to [track my progress in the 50-book challenge](http://www.shelfari.com/groups/10773/discussions/44122/Brett-Miller-s-50-Book-Challenge#362479) for last year.  But, I have to admit, I didn&#8217;t really care for the way the site worked so I didn&#8217;t use it much.

[<img title="GoodReads Logo" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.goodreads.com/images/layout/gr_logo.gif?resize=200%2C41" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200" height="41" align="right" data-recalc-dims="1" />](http://www.goodreads.com)A couple of weeks ago, through a tweet from [@randyholloway](http://www.twitter.com/randyholloway), I learned of [GoodReads](http://www.goodreads.com), another social network built around books.  (Despite [all the predictions to the contrary](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/2007/books-books-and-more-books), books are obviously alive and well!) My first impression of GoodReads was that I liked it, so I decided to give it a try.

I can&#8217;t say exactly what it is that I like about GoodReads more than Shelfari.  I do like the ability to update my status in a book, including adding comments along the way.  I also like that you can use formatting and other html in the body of reviews and other text fields; the lack of this always frustrated me in Shelfari.

I also like the layout and display a bit better; I understand the shelf motif that Shelfari uses, I just don&#8217;t think it really translates that well to the web.  (Cool to look at once, but not really usable over time imho.)  Having RSS feeds for the different &#8220;shelves&#8221; is also nice, gives me a simple way to add my list of reading, to-read, and read to this blog (check the right column) or any other sight.

As for the social networking aspect of GoodReads, I haven&#8217;t really had a chance to take advantage of them yet.  In this regard I think it may be about the same as Shelfari, with the ability to find others who are reading the same or similar books and to find other books that I may enjoy.

Of course, there was no way I was going to go back in and add 200+ books into yet another site.  I&#8217;ll keep my Shelfari shelves intact as an archive of my pre-2009 reading, and my [GoodReads shelves](http://www.goodreads.com/gbrettmiller "my book shelves on GoodReads.com") will serve as a record of my 2009 and beyond reading.
