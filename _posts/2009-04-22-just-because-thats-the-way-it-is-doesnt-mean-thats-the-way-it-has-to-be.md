In a [tweet](http://twitter.com/Think_Better/status/1588145595) earlier today, [@Think_Better](http://twitter.com/think_better) makes the following suggestion:

> Next time someone says, &#8220;That&#8217;s just the way it is,&#8221; try asking, &#8220;What would be an alternative?&#8221;

It is all too easy to get stuck in the rut of doing things the way they&#8217;ve always been done just because that is the way it has always been done.  This one little question can make all the difference, if you just take the time to ask &#8211; and answer &#8211; it. Just think of the possibilities.

This brought to mind something I [wrote](http://http://autism.gbrettmiller.com/2008/08/just-the-way-it-is-but-dont-you-believe-them/ "That's just the way it is (but don't you believe them)") back in Aug 08 (on my now shut down [29 Marbles](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com) blog) that I thought would be appropriate to repost here.

>     Frequent readers of this blog know that in my attempt to understand autism better, I have a tendency to see connections in things that aren’t always directly related to autism.  A lot of times this will come in the form of a song, a TV show, or a main- or sub-theme in a movie (like the <a href="http://autism.gbrettmiller.com/2006/04/more-thoughts-on-autism-inspired-by-the-x-men-film-trilogy/">X-Men trilogy</a>).

>     My post yesterday brought to mind <a href="http://www.brucehornsby.com/">Bruce Hornsby</a>’s (excellent) song, The Way It Is (from the <a href="http://www.brucehornsby.com/album_the_way_it_is.htm">album of the same name</a>).

>     “Don’t you believe them.”  Don’t listen when someone tells you that you can’t change things, that this is how it was meant to be.  Nothing is “meant to be”, that is the wonder of being human, that we determine what is for ourselves.

>     Note that in the chorus after the last verse, Hornsby never says “don’t you believe them”.  I don’t know if this was intentional or not, but it is definitely true.  You can make a law, you can tell people what they have to do, but you can’t tell them how to think about others.  That takes education, persistence, and persuasion.

When was the last time you asked yourself, or someone else, &#8220;Why is it this way? Is there another way that is better?&#8221; When is the next time you&#8217;ll ask?
