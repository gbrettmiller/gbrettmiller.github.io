From [The Simple but Ingenious System Taiwan Uses to Crowdsource its Laws](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611816/the-simple-but-ingenious-system-taiwan-uses-to-crowdsource-its-laws/), a story about using online networks to not just change conversation about important topics but to actually **allow** for conversation. Instead of simply answering a question, providing the opportunity to explore, learn about, convince, and be convinced. 

For example: 

> This suggests people had concluded that, in fact, “To cane or not to cane?” was the wrong question to ask. That kind of realization, and solution, wouldn’t have emerged from a traditional online petition that only gives people the option of voting yes or no.
