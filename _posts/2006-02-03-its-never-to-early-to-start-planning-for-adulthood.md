From the article  [Web site debuts to help disabled make transition](http://www.delawareonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060202/NEWS/602020360/-1/NEWS01): 

> While in public school, students with disabilities have individual education plans designed by parents, their class- room teachers and professional teams that include a psychologist. The plan is renewed annually, and the final plan is supposed to include a transition plan.
> 
> But the shift after school still is a jolt to many&#8230;.
> 
> &#8216;<span style="font-weight:bold;">&#8230; the reality is, you have to take the initiative</span>,&#8217; Lund said. &#8216;<span style="font-weight:bold;">You have to understand it on your own</span>. This [Web site] will be one more tool.&#8217;

I&#8217;ve emphasized what I think is the key point here: There are plenty of people and organizations out there that will help you plan the transition, but no one is going to do it for you. 

It&#8217;s never too early.
