Watching, listening to, and reading about the response to Hurricane Katrina I have noticed that, in general, the “official” response of government has been almost universally denounced as slow and insufficient while the “un-official” responses of individuals and various organizations have been praised as rapid and, at times, heroic. 

Though there is still a lot of analysis to be done in terms of what worked and actually made a difference, at first glance these two ends of the response spectrum provide some real world, real time insight into the question of what type of organizational culture and knowledge management is better – that which is designed top-down or that which is “grown” from the bottom up.

Instead of the term “better”, I think the term “more appropriate” is, well, more appropriate. The two different styles of KM are best used in the circumstances they are best suited for. In a crisis situation such as this, there is no question (at least in my mind) that the ad-hoc, bottoms up method of doing things works best. But I don’t believe it is scaleable to the level needed for the medium- to long-term KM needs.

I think that what will come out of the inevitable investigations into “what went wrong” is not that top-down KM doesn’t work, but rather that there was no effective KM system or process in place to support the required top-down operations. This was, as far as I know, the first major catastrophe that [FEMA](http://www.fema.gov/) has had to deal with since being incorporated into the [Department of Homeland Security](http://www.dhs.gov/dhspublic/) bureaucracy. _(See_ [Destroying FEMA](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/29/AR2005082901445.html) _for more on FEMA and DHS.)_ 

There is obviously a bit of work that still needs to be done to make sure that all threats, natural and man-made, are adequately managed from a knowledge perspective. I’m sure that we’ll hear more on that once Congress starts its investigations.
