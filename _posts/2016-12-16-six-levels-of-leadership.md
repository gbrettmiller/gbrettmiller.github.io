All leaders – from team leader to CEO – shape an image of their reality. But they don’t look through the same lens. On the whole, we can identify six levels of leadership, six types of leaders who have a different level of consciousness, and as a consequence, will develop strategic plans, initiate actions and create value for their organization from a different (less or more complex) perspective. As we will see, depending on the level of consciousness, a leader will act and respond differently to the challenges that arise.

You will be introduced to six levels of leadership, six levels of consciousness⁴.

Let’s meet the six types of leaders. What type are you?  
1. “Solution” leaders  
2. “Best practice” leaders  
3. “Strategic development” leaders  
4. “Transformational” leaders  
5. “Global” leaders  
6. “Captains of society”
