This article, [Autism Research Could Lead To Lab Test](http://www.13wham.com/health/local/story.aspx?content_id=BDDF56C3-B4E4-4E3C-8FB7-317373439716), is interesting in many aspects. The one that jumped out at me, however, was the implication that autism isn&#8217;t something you have, it is something you can get (emphasis below is mine): 

> The study also might lead to a lab test that could detect if someone <span style="font-weight:bold;">is at risk of having autism</span>. Right now, the only way to diagnose autism is through behavior. The discovery that too much of a particular protein in the body linked to autism could lead to a blood test for this disease.
> 
> &#8216;If we know that children are <span style="font-weight:bold;">at higher risk</span> and we have a way to screen for it, we can certainly intervene much sooner,&#8217; she said.

Just like cancer or heart disease, where some people are more susceptible to &#8220;catching&#8221; it than others, no matter how much/little environmental influence there is. (I think we all know people who have smoked all their lives and never gotten lung cancer, while there are those who seem to &#8216;catch&#8217; it for no reason at all.) 

Perhaps this is a first step along the way of showing that nature/nurture &#8211; genetics/environment link between autism and environmental triggers?

Of course, it also brings up questions of what it means to &#8216;cure&#8217; autism, or even prevent it. Is a child &#8220;at risk&#8221; of becoming autistic when they are 6 months old, or are they already autistic but just don&#8217;t know it.

I won&#8217;t even go into the questions/issues related to pre-natal testing for autism. At least not right now&#8230;.
