    <a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/the-book/"><img class="alignright" title="Cover - The Art of Non-Conformity" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.chrisguillebeau.com/images/aonc-cover.png?resize=169%2C225" alt="" width="169" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/">Chris Guillebeau</a>&#8216;s new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0399536108?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0399536108">The Art of Non-Conformity</a>,<img style="border:none !important;margin:0!important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=gbrettmiller-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0399536108" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> is clear, concise, and gets straight to the point. Chris tries to eliminate &#8220;busy work&#8221; from his life, and he&#8217;s done an excellent job of eliminating &#8220;busy reading&#8221; from this book.

  <p>
    This is a book about living the life that you want to live and not the life that someone else wants you to live. And that is what I found most refreshing about the book: Chris isn&#8217;t saying be a rebel and do things just because someone else said you couldn&#8217;t (or shouldn&#8217;t); he&#8217;s saying don&#8217;t do something just because someone else says you should.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The message is a positive one &#8211; figure out what it is that you want from your life and do that. And allow &#8211; encourage &#8211; others to do the same. This last point, I think, is especially valuable for parents, whoÂ should read this book and keep it in mind as they raise their kids and prepare them for their own adventures in the world. (A <a title="Parents should be leaders, not managers" href="http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/parents-should-be-leaders-not-managers/">theme I&#8217;ve touched on before</a>.)

    If you are not currently a non-conformist, you will think &#8220;no way&#8221; and &#8220;he&#8217;s crazy&#8221; more than once as you read through this book; but if you make it all the way through you&#8217;ll thank him for it in the end. If you think you are already a non-conformist, you will likely realize that you really aren&#8217;t; that you are perhaps more rebel and less non-conformist.

    A must read for just about everyone.
