It is a good time to be a virtual musician, especially if your platform of choice comes from [Nintendo](http://www.nintendo.com/). This past weekend saw the release of versions of the popular [Guitar Hero](http://www.guitarhero.com/us/) and [Rock Band](http://www.rockband.com/) game franchises for the [Nintendo DS](http://www.nintendo.com/ds) and the [Nintendo Wii](http://www.nintendo.com/wii), respectively.

[Guitar Hero On Tour](http://www.guitarhero.com/ghot/us/#/home/) brings the guitar strumming fun to the DS. I had a chance to try it out over the weekend and it is, in the words of my niece, &#8220;freaking sweet&#8221;. Like the console versions, GHOT has a custom guitar controller.

&#8220;But the DS doesn&#8217;t use separate controllers,&#8221; you say? Check this out:

<p style="text-align:center;">
  <img class="aligncenter" style="vertical-align:middle;" src="https://i1.wp.com/static.gamesradar.com/images/mb/GamesRadar/us/Games/G/Guitar%20Hero%20DS/Everything%20Else/Art/RAW/gh_on_tour_guitar_grip--article_image.jpg?resize=222%2C174" alt="" width="222" height="174" data-recalc-dims="1" />
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  That in combination with a pick-shaped stylus and the DS touch screen make for very cool game play. Check out the <a href="http://www.guitarhero.com/ghot/us/#/home/">official game site</a> for all the details.

  The Wii version of Rock Band is, I&#8217;m sure, quite similar to the <a href="http://www.us.playstation.com/PS3">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/">XBox 360</a> versions in terms of music and playability. Since I already have Rock Band for PS3 (working my way through a &#8220;Hard&#8221; solo tour), I doubt if I&#8217;ll get the Wii version, but I know my brother&#8217;s kids are already hounding him for the Wii version.
