I have had a lot of teachers throughout my life. Some taught me because they were paid to, some because they were supposed to, and some because they wanted to. Many of the best teachers in my life, though, had no idea that they were teaching me. (Or, perhaps more accurately, that I was learning from them.) 

At the top of this list of unintentional teachers are kids, especially my own. 

When the relationship between parents and their kids is discussed, &#8220;parent as teacher&#8221; is a common interpretation. There is no doubt that parents need to teach their children. But if we only see ouselves as teachers, whether it is because we are supposed to or because we really want to, we are missing out on some of the greatest learning opportunities we will ever be given the chance to experience. 

This is especially true if your kids are different from you, or different from what you expected them to be. For example, if you are a &#8220;jock&#8221; and your kid a &#8220;geek&#8221; ( or vice versa). Or your kid is disabled and you&#8217;re not. 

If you are a parent, take the time to learn from your kids. You&#8217;ll be amazed at what they can teach you.
