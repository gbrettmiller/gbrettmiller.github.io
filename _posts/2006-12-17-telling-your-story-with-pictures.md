Among many observations I made from the exercise, key was how different people interpreted what was meant by &#8220;how a toaster works.&#8221; Some of us took it to mean &#8220;How do you make toast with a toaster&#8221; while others approached it from the &#8220;how does a toaster function&#8221; point of view. (It was pretty easy to pick out engineers in the crowd!) Scott has posted the [scanned cards on Flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/scottmstl/sets/72157594385839524/ "SIM Toasters - a photoset on Flickr").

Photographer Volker Steger gave a similar visual story telling challenge to past Nobel laureates in the article and photo layout [Nobel Notations](http://www.discover.com/issues/dec-06/features/nobel-winners-draw-discoveries/ "Nobel Notations - Discover Magazine") in the [December 2006](http://www.discover.com/issues/dec-06 "Discover - December 2006") issue of [Discover magazine](http://www.discover.com "Discover magazine"), in which he asked these great minds to explain their prize winning achievements using crayons and a piece of poster board.

> <span id="article_text">The scientists&#8217; artwork draws out unexpected and often deeply personal details. Curl&#8217;s depiction of the buckyball&#8217;s creation hints at a dispute over the naming of the molecule. He favored &#8220;soccerene&#8221; for its soccer-ball shape, but his British cowinner, <a target="_blank" href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1996/kroto-autobio.html">Sir Harold Kroto</a>, nixed that idea, arguing that in England the game is called football and that the molecule ought to be called &#8220;footballene.&#8221; (In the end, it was named for architect Buckminster Fuller&#8217;s celebrated geodesic domes.)</span>
