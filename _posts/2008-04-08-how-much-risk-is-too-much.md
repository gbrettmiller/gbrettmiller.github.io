In a [comment](//autism.wpadmin.about.com/?comments_popup=258116',400,550)) to [Lisa Jo Rudy&#8217;s brief examination](http://autism.about.com/b/2008/04/08/so-what-is-the-autismvaccine-debate-about-anyway.htm "About.com Autism:  So... What Is the Autism/Vaccine Debate About, Anyway?") of some of the issues in the autism-vaccine debate, Dadvocate had this to say:

> Rather, it is that some, in their zeal to promote public health may be erroneously accepting a level of adverse reaction risk that is too high (and possibly avoidable by reverting to a more conservative schedule)&#8230;.

The obvious (to me) question from this is, &#8220;Given that the current vaccine schedule results in an unacceptably high risk of autism in vaccinated children, what level of risk is acceptable? If the current risk is 1-in-150 (which, I should note is actually the prevalence and not the odds of being autistic), what risk is acceptable? 1-in-500? 1-in-1000? 1-in 10,000? None?&#8221;

This question is really for those who believe that vaccines are to blame for autism, and is but one strand in a much more complex thread. Among other things, the risk of individuals becoming autistic would need to be weighed against the risk to the public at large of reducing vaccinations.

At the risk of [retreading old ground](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com/2008/01/not-in-my-backyard-vaccines-autism-and-acceptable-losses/ "29 Marbles - Not in my backyard: Vaccines, autism, and acceptable losses"), exactly where do you think the balancing point would be between protection of individuals from autism and protection of society from communicable diseases? (If you don&#8217;t think this is a valid question, by all means let me know. I&#8217;m interested in that possibility as well.)
