Actually, looking back at my first attempt to use the framework to look at an issue, back in a [November 2008 look at the response to the global economic crisis](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/the-cynefin-framework-and-the-global-economic-crisis/ "The Cynefin framework and the global economic crisis"), it looks like I may have understood it better than I thought I did. But then I started taking it places I don&#8217;t think it was ever meant to go.<!--more-->

I started going wrong when I slipped back into thinking of the 2&#215;2 as a categorization model, instead of what it actually is: a **sensemaking** framework. The domains themselves are unimportant, aside from the fact that they exist, it is how you react to a situation in those domains that is important. And whether you can understand or figure out which domain you are in.

The video goes through a description of each of the domains included in the framework, which is something I did understand, and a brief discussion of the appropriate method to address challenges in each of the domains. Even these I understood. What I hadn&#8217;t really understood, what wasn&#8217;t really clear to me before watching the video (and actually paying attention!), were the implications of applying an inappropriate method to a given situation.

Especially eye opening for me was the discussion about the transition boundary between the **simple** and **chaotic** domains. As someone who works in an historically bureaucratic organization that has a strong desire to create and use best practices, and a tendency to try to fit everything into the simple domain, I found this to be probably the single most important takeaway from the video &#8211; if you want to ensure the failure of your organization, just pretend like everything is simple and has a one-size-fits-all solution.

The other key insight I gained from the video was an essential distinction between ordered systems &#8211; simple and complicated &#8211; and complex and chaotic systems: ordered systems are things you already know and understand, you just have to find the answer; complex and chaotic systems are things you don&#8217;t yet know or understand, and you have to learn as you go. (I had just read Dave Gray&#8217;s description of the difference between training and learning in **The Connected Company**, so was primed to see this distinction.)

_Note: it is not unlikely, and entirely possible that I&#8217;ve got it completely wrong. Or, to [paraphrase Richard Feynman](http://gbrettmiller.com/2013/if-you-think-you-understand-quantum-physics/ ""If you think you understand quantum physics...""): If you think you understand Cynefin, you don&#8217;t understand Cynefin. _
