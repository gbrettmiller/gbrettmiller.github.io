Writing about **[The Fifth Discipline](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385260954/gbrettmiller-20)** got me thinking about it all over again. I have to admit that the last time I read the book as a whole was well over a year ago, and it has been several months since I&#8217;ve even referenced it. As a result, everything I said in my last post is likely a load of [hooey](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=hooey). Since I don&#8217;t have the book handy, I did the next best thing and went to the [Society of Organizational Learning](http://www.sol-ne.org)&#8216;s site to see what is new in the area of organizational learning.

The leading item was the [Foundations for Leadership](http://www.sol-ne.org/capacity/foundations_for_leadership/) course of the subject of this post. From the site, who should attend: 

> This course is intended for everyone commited to deepening their capacity for effective leadership &#8211; including those in senior management positions and those with no formal authority. Teams are encouraged to attend to further develop their collective leadership.

I&#8217;ll leave the rest of the site for you to explore&#8230;
