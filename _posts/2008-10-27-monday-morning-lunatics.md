Another song that brought my experiences with autism to mind, [Dream Theater](http://www.dreamtheater.net/)&#8216;s Solitary Shell, from the [Six Degrees of Separation CD](http://www.dreamtheater.net/disco_dreamtheater.php?s=6doit).

= = == === =====

He seemed no different from the rest  
Just a healthy normal boy  
His mama always did her best  
And he was daddy&#8217;s pride and joy

He learned to walk and talk on time  
But never cared much to be held  
And steadily he would decline  
Into his solitary shell

As a boy he was considered somewhat odd  
Kept to himself most of the time  
He would daydream in and out of his own world  
But in every other way he was fine

He&#8217;s a monday morning lunatic  
Disturbed from time to time  
Lost withing himself  
In his solitary shell

A temporary catatonic  
Madman on occasion  
When will he break out  
Of his solitary shell

===== === == = =

I have no idea if this song was written to be specifically about autism, but I doubt it.  It could just be about an extremely introverted kid.

The question that pops to mind:  Why does the child in the song need to &#8220;break out of his solitary shell&#8221; at all?
