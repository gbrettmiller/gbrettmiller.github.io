A key aspect of personal development is an understanding of yourself &#8211; your strengths, your weaknesses, your personality, and your style of accomplishing things. Aside from a good amount of self reflection, there are tools &#8211; usually in the form of &#8216;tests&#8217; &#8211; that can help you gain this understanding.

Some such tests are purely for fun. For example:

  * If I were a superhero, [I&#8217;d be Spiderman](http://www.seabreezecomputers.com/superhero "Superhero Personality Test")
  * I&#8217;m a [Hobby Blogger](http://www.problogger.net/problogger-quiz/ "Problogger Quiz") (apparently based on the amount of money I don&#8217;t try to make from blogging)
  * I am a [Supreme Nerd](http://www.wxplotter.com/ft_nq.php "How NERDY are You?") (I scored 93 out of 100)

But there are also more serious tools, such as the various personality type indicators ([Myers Briggs](http://www.similarminds.com/ "Myers Briggs Personality Test"), [Keirsey](http://www.keirsey.com/ "Keirsey Temperament Website"), etc). (Most days, I seem to be an [INTP](http://keirsey.com/personality/ntip.html "The Portrait of the Architect Rational (Keirsey)").) [Dennis Kennedy](http://www.denniskennedy.com/blog/2006/08/your_innovation_style.html "Your Innovation Style (DennisKennedy.blog)") and [Jack Vinson](http://blog.jackvinson.com/archives/2006/08/22/my_innovation_style_exploring.html "My innovation style:  Exploring (Jack Vinson)") both point to another of these useful tools, [the Innovation Style Profiler,](https://innovationstyles.com/is2006/Welcome.aspx?s=IT2006 "Welcome to Innovation Styles Profiler") at [Innovation Styles](http://innovationstyles.com/isinc/ "Innovation Styles"). As the title suggests, the profiler will give you insight into your innovation style, of which there are four main types:

  * Visioning: to visualize the ideal future
  * Modifying: to build on and optimize what has come before
  * Exploring: to discover new perspectives, assumptions, and territory
  * Experimenting: to combine and test many novel combinations

I had put together some thoughts on these tools, but Jack beat me to it. Here&#8217;s what he had to say (emphasis is mine):

<blockquote title="My Innovation Style - Exploring" cite="http://blog.jackvinson.com/archives/2006/08/22/my_innovation_style_exploring.html">
  <p>
    The <a href="http://www.innovationstyles.com/is2006/abouttheisp.aspx">explanations</a> of each style they provide are both informative and entertaining. As with the various personality style tests (<a href="http://blog.jackvinson.com/archives/2003/10/17/today_i_am_entj.html">MTBI</a>, Kiersey, and many others), the purpose of these styles is to <strong>help people understand how they approach innovation</strong> (not how innovative they are). And if taken in a group setting can help members of the group see <strong>how they approach things differently</strong>. The thinking here is that <em><strong>the better we know ourselves and those around us, the better we can work together</strong></em> &#8211; in this case for the purposes of innovative thinking.
  </p>
</blockquote>

For a counterpoint to the value of these types of indicators, you may want to check out the [Skeptic&#8217;s Dictionary](http://skepdic.com/contents.html "Table of Contents - Skeptics Dictionary") entry on the [Myers Briggs Type Indicator](http://skepdic.com/myersb.html "Myers Briggs Type Indicator (r) - Skeptics Dictionary"). (Thanks to [Dave Snowden](http://www.cognitive-edge.com/2006/07/the_skeptics_dictionary.php "the Skeptics Dictionary (Cognitive Edge)") for the link.)

In case you&#8217;re interested I am a Visioning/Exploring type of innovator.
