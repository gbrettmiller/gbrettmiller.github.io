As I&#8217;m reading **[The Wisdom of Crowds](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385503865/gbrettmiller-20)**, I can&#8217;t help wondering what the implications of the book&#8217;s findings are on Knowledge Management, etc. (I tried to look it up in the index but the book doesn&#8217;t seem to have one.) A recurring theme in Knowledge Management and related fields is that of sharing knowledge across an organization so that everyone knows what is going on everywhere else. 

I&#8217;m not very far into the book yet, but as I understand it the wisdom of the crowds increases as the crowd becomes more diverse and <span style="font-weight:bold;">each member of the crowd has private information that no one else has</span>. The book also seems to be going down the path of arguing that in order for crowds to make good decisions, the members of the crowd should [look out for number one](http://nsl.blogspot.com/2004/05/looking-out-for-number-one.html) and in the aggregate the crowd will make the best decision (for the crowd, not necessarily for the individual).

Hmmmmm&#8230;&#8230;. I need to get back to reading.
