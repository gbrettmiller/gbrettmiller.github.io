excerpt: Like modern musicians, bloggers and others using social media have an almost unfathomable selection of tools available. But in the end, it is about making music, not using the tools.

To make music these days, musicians need to know just a bit more than how to play their instrument. A guitar player, for example, needs to be able to play the guitar (a given), but also must have an understanding of how the guitar is built, what accessories provide what features, how to mic the amps. Likewise a drummer, bass player, or other band member. Then comes the process of recording music to produce a song and, hopefully, all the work that goes into putting on a live performance. There are a seemingly endless supply of options available to these musicians that must be overwhelming at times.

Kind of like the seemingly endless onslaught of new collaboration tools and ways to communicate with others.

A little over 5 years ago, I wrote the following:

> I’ve been messing around with blogs (with varying success) for over 5 years now, have set up and contributed to my fair share of other online sources like wikis and as a commenter to other blogs. But I’ve only recently really understood the value and, yes, appeal of text messaging and the ability to send photos and videos from anywhere on my phone. And, though I’ve recently signed up and started experimenting with Facebook, I’m still not quite sure exactly what to do with it. And don’t get me started with things like Twitter – as much as friends and others praise it, I just don’t get it.

Of course, it has only gotten worse (better?) since then.<figure id="attachment_217" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright">

I have spent the better part of the past year or so exploring and trying out new tools, seeing where they add value or don&#8217;t. I still don&#8217;t use [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com "Facebook") much, but have found my groove with [Twitter](http://twitter.com "Twitter"). I see the value and potential of [Google+](http://plus.google.com "Google +") but just can&#8217;t quite get into it. On the other hand, I have come to love and rely on [Jive](http://www.jivesoftware.com "Jive - Social Business Software") in our &#8220;behind the firewall&#8221; social/business network. I&#8217;ve signed up for many of the niche services that have come out: I really like [Instagram](http://instagram.com "Instagram - a fast, beautiful and fun way to share your photos with friends and family."), [Untappd](http://untappd.com "Untappd - a mobile app that allows you to socially share the brew you're currently enjoying, as well as where you're enjoying it, with your friends!") is a cool idea, and I don&#8217;t get [Pinterest](http://pinterest.com "Pinterest - social pin boards") (at all). <span style="color:#333333;font-size:15.454545021057px;font-style:normal;line-height:21.818181991577px;">A</span><span style="color:#333333;font-size:15.454545021057px;font-style:normal;line-height:21.818181991577px;"> quick look at the feed selection list for the </span><a style="font-size:15.454545021057px;font-style:normal;line-height:21.818181991577px;" title="Lifestream" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/lifestream/"><strong>Lifestream</strong> plugin for WordPress</a> <span style="color:#333333;font-size:15.454545021057px;font-style:normal;line-height:21.818181991577px;">gives an idea of what&#8217;s out there. </span><span style="color:#333333;font-size:15.454545021057px;font-style:normal;line-height:21.818181991577px;">I have no idea what most of them are, and this isn&#8217;t even all of them! (Lifestream provides a way for you to add &#8220;generic&#8221; feeds for all those that they&#8217;ve missed.)</span>

Speaking of [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org "WordPress.org")&#8230; Although I haven&#8217;t been blogging publicly for a while (16 months or so, yikes!), spending a lot of time writing and making things happen behind the firewall, I have kept up with the evolution of WordPress and the great tools available in the system, not to mention the evolution of its positioning in the market from &#8220;just another &#8230; blog&#8221; to &#8220;just another &#8230; site&#8221;. I&#8217;ve read a couple of good WordPress books through my Safari Books Online subscription, and played around a bit under the hood.

<img class="alignright" style="color:#333333;font-size:15.454545021057px;font-style:normal;line-height:21.818181991577px;margin-top:.4em;" title="WordCamp St. Louis – September 22nd" alt="Wordcamp St. Louis 2012" src="https://i0.wp.com/2012.stlouis.wordcamp.org/files/2012/07/wcstl-ver_attending.png?resize=176%2C193" width="176" height="193" data-recalc-dims="1" /> 

And in a couple of weeks I&#8217;m attending [WordCamp St. Louis 2012](http://2012.stlouis.wordcamp.org/ "WordCamp St. Louis 2012") to learn and share even more.

I could say that all this goodness was part of why it has taken me so long to actually get back up and running. (I told [@tomcatalini](http://twitter.com/tomcatalini "Tom Catalini on Twitter (you should follow him)") back in April that I was &#8220;very close&#8221; to a return to blogging, not sure 4 months counts as &#8220;very close&#8221;.) And though it sounds like an excuse it is, at least partly, true. Part of my absence has been directly related to my trying to figure out what direction I wanted this blog to take, to build on my previous blogs or to try something new. But part has been trying to understand what is possible with regards to how I do it.

A perfect example of this interplay was my discovery of different [post formats](http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats "Post Formats (from WordPress Codex)"), along with the Showcase page template in the Twenty Eleven theme, and how I could use it to capture and present both my own extended thoughts on things (an ounce of perception) and a log of my more random thoughts and observations (a pound of obscure).

<span style="color:#333333;font-size:15.454545021057px;font-style:normal;line-height:21.818181991577px;">I don&#8217;t need to worry about all those sites and services in the list above that I don&#8217;t know about, or know how to use, nor do I need to worry about all the bells and whistles in WordPress. Perhaps they will be of value to me some day, and if so I expect that I will find them if and when I need them. </span><span style="color:#333333;font-size:15.454545021057px;font-style:normal;line-height:21.818181991577px;">What I care about is what I can do with them. </span>

Like the musicians I mentioned earlier, my purpose is not to &#8220;play an instrument&#8221; or to set up a bunch of gear. My purpose is to make music, and all this machinery is just a way to do that.

Now, let&#8217;s see what kind of music I can make&#8230;.
