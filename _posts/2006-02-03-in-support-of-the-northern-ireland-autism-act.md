I&#8217;m not exactly sure what the [Northern Ireland Autism Act](http://www.newsletter.co.uk/story/25923) entails, but I really like what supporter Robert Coulter has to say in support of it:

> There is a place for people with ASD in society and they must have their worth recognised and their rights guaranteed. They are not mentally ill people and they have a tremendous contribution to make. 
> 
> If we fail as politicians to deliver this Act, if Autism Northern Ireland fails to generate the necessary lobbying in our community, then the NI Mental Health and Learning Disability Review could condemn thousands in our community to a life of uncertainty and increased stress for their loved ones.
