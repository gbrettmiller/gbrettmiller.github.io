In [my last post](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/2007/the-serendipity-of-knowledge "NSL:  The serendipity of knowledge"), I recommended buying just a couple of [Liquid Tension Experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_Tension_Experiment "wikipedia:  Liquid Tension Experiment") songs from the [iTunes store](http://www.itunes.com "Apple:  iTunes") if you didn&#8217;t think you were up for the whole album. I must admit, I&#8217;ve never really considered how iTunes handles buying a whole album if you&#8217;ve already bought an individual song or two, but thanks to [MacNN | Apple may credit iTunes album purchases](http://www.macnn.com/articles/07/03/26/itunes.album.credit/), I know now. Interesting, since I guess I always thought this is how it should work anyway.

A good, though small, example of a company re-inventing how it does things.Â  Worth a quick read if you buy from iTunes.
