Just a little while ago, I learned of (what is to me) an interesting website: [OpposingViews.com](http://www.opposingviews.com). As the name suggests, it is a place for people to discuss their opposing views. A newly started debate entitled [Are Autism and Vaccines Linked](http://www.opposingviews.com/questions/are-autism-and-vaccines-linked) is up and running that I thought my readers would be interested in.

I&#8217;m not exactly sure how the site works, or how &#8220;experts&#8221; are verified, but as of the time I write this post, the debate seems to be between Dr. Jennifer Shu on the **NO** side and the National Autism Association, SafeMinds, and Dr. Karima Hirani on the **YES** side. Those of us who are not &#8220;verified experts&#8221; can post comments to the arguments put forth by the experts. At the time of me writing this, there are 21 comments, all from supporters of the YES argument trying to shoot down the NO arguments.

I have the feeling, though, that will change very quickly as word gets out about this public debate.
