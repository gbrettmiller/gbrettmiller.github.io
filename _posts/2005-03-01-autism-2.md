For parents of toddlers around 18 month old, few words are more disturbing than **[AUTISM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism)**. Unfortunately, more and more parents are hearing this word more and more often from their pediatricians. As recently as 30 years ago or less, 1 in 10,000 children were diagnosed with autism. Today, that number is 1 in 166. (You read it right &#8211; one in **one hundred sixty six** &#8211; two full orders of magnitude!)

The obvious question that arises from this drastic increase: &#8220;Is this because more kids have autism, or are we just getting better at diagnosing it, or what?&#8221; The answer, I think, falls into the &#8220;or what&#8221; category. 

As way of background, I am the parent of an autistic son, Zeke, who is now 13 years old. Obviously, I have more than a passing interest in the current state of things in the world of autism, and there are many things to keep up with:

  * the search for a cure 
      * nutritional / medical interventions 
          * school 
              * life after school</ul> 
                I&#8217;ve created this blog to help me sort through things for myself and to share what I find.
