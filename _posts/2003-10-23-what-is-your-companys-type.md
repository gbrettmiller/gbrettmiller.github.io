Just as there are different temperament types for people, it seems reasonable to think that there are different &#8220;temperament&#8221; types for organizations. Understanding the temperament of the organization you are in &#8211; or the organization you are consulting for &#8211; can go a long way in helping you do what is best for the organization.

Of course, this leads to the question of how do you determine the temperament of an organization? I did a quick [Google](http://www.google.com) search on &#8220;[Organizational Temperament Type](http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=organizational+temperament+type)&#8221; and I got a lot of results for individual temperament types in the context of organizational behavior, but nothing on the &#8220;type&#8221; of organizations. Maybe I just used a bad search term.

Is there a questionaire out there that could be applied to an organization? How would you apply it, since you can&#8217;t really ask the organization questions. Observation, maybe, where you answer the question for them? Or would you maybe ask different people from different parts of the organization specific questions and then pull them together? Would you use the same 16 types? Or would it be a subset of these? Or would it be completely different?

I&#8217;ll continue to search for more on that, but if anyone has thoughts on this or knows of something that has already been done, I&#8217;d love to hear about it.
