[Jack Vinson](http://jackvinson.com/about.html "Jack Vinson, President of Knowledge Jolt, Inc") has [tagged me](http://blog.jackvinson.com/archives/2006/12/15/blog_tag_game_5_things.html "Knowledge Jolt with Jack: Blog tag game") to tell the world 5 things that most people may not know about me. It is more of a challenge than I thought it might be, trying to figure out what I&#8217;m will to share and what people may be interested in knowing. But here goes.

  1. I have lived/worked/vacationed in 37 US states (plus the District of Columbia) and 18 countries outside the US including North America, Europe, and Asia. My wife and I spent our first anniversary riding gondola&#8217;s and checking out the history of Venice. Very nice.
  2. I attended [The Wall &#8211; Live in Berlin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Concert_in_Berlin "The Wall Concert in Berlin - wikipedia") performance at [_Potsdamer Platz_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potsdamer_Platz "Potsdamer Platz - wikipedia") in July 1990. Though the early part of the concert was plagued with technical difficulties, the overall experience was amazing. Not the least of the experience was the trip to Berlin: a route that showed about 8 hours on the map ended up taking nearly 20 hours. Though [Allied Checkpoint Charlie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkpoint_Charlie "Checkpoint Charlie - wikipedia") had already come down within Berlin, we spent nearly 10 hours in line trying to get through Checkpoint Alpha. I also had the chance to take hammer and chisel to the Berlin Wall and break off my own souvenir of the Cold War.
  3. [<img width="175" vspace="10" hspace="10" height="156" align="right" alt="Yoshi and Kirby in the Park" title="Yoshi and Kirby in the Park" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm1.static.flickr.com/140/329227465_797ae19060.jpg?resize=175%2C156" data-recalc-dims="1" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/gbrettmiller/329227465/ "Photo Sharing")I&#8217;m a dog person, big dogs. For pretty much my entire married life (going on 20 years), we&#8217;ve had at least one (usually two) dogs in the house. We currently have two [Old English Sheepdogs](http://www.oes.org/ "Everything about Old English Sheepdogs"), and have had another Sheepdog and a [_Bouvier des Flandres_](http://www.bouvier.org/ "American Bouvier des Flandres Club") along the way.
  4. In high school, I worked as a summer camp counselor. This is where I really picked up my love of all things outdoors, such as rock climbing, caving, canoing, etc.
  5. In college, I was co-leader of my fraternity&#8217;s award winning float building team for the annual St. Pat&#8217;s day parade. The theme was cartoons / animation, we won with Disney&#8217;s The Jungle Book.

Update (21 Dec): Watching Jeopardy this evening I thought of something else that I should have put here, but just didn’t think of in time.

I took the contestant test for Jeopardy once, 7 or 8 years ago. Now, I usually do pretty good playing along with the show, so I thought to myself, “No problem.” Ha. HA HA!!

If I remember correctly, there were 10 questions on the test. Two of them I knew, two of them I thought I knew (I didn’t), and the rest I had absolutely no idea what they were talking about. I was almost embarrassed to tell anyone how it went, but when I did most reacted with, “But you do so well when you play along.”

Talk about a humbling experience.
