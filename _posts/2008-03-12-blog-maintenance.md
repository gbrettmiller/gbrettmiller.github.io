Just to let you know, I&#8217;m going to be going through some blog maintenance over the next day or two, including an update of the [WordPress software](http://wordpress.org/) and databases and a possible template change (haven&#8217;t decided about that one, yet). I&#8217;m also planning to import posts from the original [&#8230;no straight lines&#8230;](http://nsl.blogspot.com) from [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com), partly to have a consolidated collection of my writing but mainly to follow [my own advice](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/2007/who-owns-your-data-who-should-own-it) (inspired by [Harold Jarche](http://www.jarche.com/?p=1401)) to &#8220;own my data.&#8221; 

I&#8217;m giving this warning because 1) I&#8217;m not sure what will happen when I import the posts, whether subscribers will get a blast of new posts or if there will be no effect, and 2) in case I screw something up you&#8217;ll know that it is my fault &#8211; not my host, [DreamHost](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?209759) &#8211; and is (hopefully) temporary until I can figure it all out. 

I&#8217;ve been keeping busy other places ([here](http://29marbles.blogspot.com), [here](http://www.stlouiselite.org), and [here](http://www.stlouiselite.org/meetmeinstlouis)), but do have a backlog of things to write about that I&#8217;ll be posting soon.
