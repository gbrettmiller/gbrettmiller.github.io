**Organizational Knowledge &#8211; What is it?**

What exactly does &#8220;organizational knowledge&#8221; mean? We know what knowledge means in people, or do we?

What level of knowledge are we thinking about? The knowledge that we are conscious of? The knowledge that we are not usually aware of but can consciously call on at times when we need it? The truly subsconscious knowledge that our body uses to keep us going?

Organizational knowledge is no different (imho).

Once we have figured out what organizational knowledge is, we can start thinking about &#8220;managing&#8221; that knowledge.

So begins the journey. Where will it lead me&#8230;.
