Welcome to **tib(na) labs**, one lab among many in the [School of the Possible](https://medium.com/school-of-the-possible). Our purpose here is to explore the _adjacent possible_ available to us today by **thinking in bits (not atoms)** and start the journey down the most promising paths.

We’re just getting started here so keep an eye out for updates, we’ll be posting more information soon.
