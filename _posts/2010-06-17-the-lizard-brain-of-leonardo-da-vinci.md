On my way back to the hotel this evening, I stopped by the El Paso History Museum to visit &#8220;The Da Vinci Experience&#8221;, an exhibit of machines and models of quite a few of da Vinci&#8217;s many inventions and ideas. Over the years I&#8217;ve read many books about da Vinci, explored his notebooks online, and even helped my son when he did a project for his world history class.

But to see his ideas physically incarnated was something else altogether.

All of the models were implemented primarily in wood, some set up as static displays (please don&#8217;t touch) and some as hands on to play with. If you&#8217;ve taken physics classes, or if you are someone who likes to tinker, many of the ideas related to pulleys, gears, and other mechanical gadgets will seem like old hat. 

Until, that is, you take a moment to consider that no one taught these things to Leonardo. He had to create the knowledge that, even today, many people find hard to understand. Knowledge that continues &#8211; 500 years later &#8211; to make our lives better. 

How did he do it? Was he smarter than the rest of us, blessed with an inate intelligence that we can only dream of. I don&#8217;t think so. Did he have better opportunities than the rest of us? The historical record shows that he started worse off than many and made his own opportunities throughout his life.

One thing is certain, da Vinci made very good use of his time. He may not have been very efficient, and he had a tendency to leave things unfinished. But he had ideas, a lot of ideas, both good and bad. And he wasn&#8217;t afraid to pursue them. He didn&#8217;t cave in to what Seth Godin calls the resistance, the lizard brain that tries to save us from ourselves.

And I think that is the real genius of Leonardo da Vinci: observe the world and follow your ideas where ever they take you, and don&#8217;t let anyone &#8211; especially you &#8211; convince you otherwise.
