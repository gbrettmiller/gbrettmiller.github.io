One of my earliest posts (Jun 12, 2003) was [KM and the Brain](http://nsl.blogspot.com/2003/06/km-and-brain.html "NSL - KM and the Brain") (included in its entirety below for ease of reference). Looking at it again nearly 2 1/2 years later I still think the main idea is valid, though I have one update.

Specifically, I think that the **neuroscience** aspect of KM relates more directly to the behavior of individuals within an organization (the **neurons** of the organization) and how they connect (or don&#8217;t) to each other. In otherwords, Personal Knowledge Management. Because the main function of IT in KM is to provide these connections, I believe it falls under this aspect as well.

&#8211; &#8211; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212;&#8211; &#8212;&#8212;&#8211; &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;- &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;

When we talk about brains, we talk about **neuroscience** as dealing with the _technology_ and **psychology/psychiatry** as dealing with the _processes_ of the brain. Many KM practitioners recognize, indeed advocate, the distinction of two perspectives on KM: **Object** and **Process**. Together they make up a **System** perspective. You can&#8217;t really look at one without the other. You can&#8217;t really **_function_** without both. As I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve deduced, I&#8217;m leading to an analogy:

> Neuroscience Object / Technology Perspective  
> Psych Process Perspective

In other words, **KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT IS THE NEUROSCIENCE AND PSYCHOLOGY/PSYCHIATRY OF AN ORGANIZATION**.  
&#8211; &#8211; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212;&#8211; &#8212;&#8212;&#8211; &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;- &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;
