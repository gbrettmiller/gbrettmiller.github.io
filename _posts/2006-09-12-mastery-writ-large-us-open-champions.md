<img align="right" title="US Open 2006 - Roger Federer wins the US Open Championship" alt="US Open 2006 - Roger Federer wins the US Open Championship" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.usopen.org/images/pics/thumbs/t_0910043_federer.jpg?w=640" data-recalc-dims="1" />This past weekend saw the crowning of new champions of tennis at the [U.S. Open](http://www.usopen.org "US Open 2006"). Congratulations to all those who competed (that takes a whole lot of mastery itself), and especially to [those who won](http://www.usopen.org/en_US/scores/index.html "US Open 2006 - Final results"). Of special note is [Roger Federer](http://www.usopen.org/en_US/bios/ms/atpf324.html "US Open 2006 - Roger Federer bio"), who showed decisively why he is considered the best in the world today. Consider these words from a US Open news story:

<blockquote title="Roger Federer - Player of the Day" cite="http://www.usopen.org/en_US/news/playerday/20060910.html">
  <p>
    And if you’re still not convinced, take a look at his resume. The current world No. 1 enjoyed a 2004 and 2006 championship in the Australian Open, the runner-up spot at this year&#8217;s French Open, and of course his exceptional four consecutive wins at Wimbledon.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As for any pessimists who previously slighted Federer as merely a grass champ, his fortitude and record the past three years on hard court at the Open quickly refute – mock, even – such ideas. His consecutive appearances in Grand Slam finals is now up to six – and the Australian Open is just around the corner.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Congratulations to a man whose finale today shot him to USOpen.org’s Player of the Day, US Open Men’s Singles Champion and the first man in history to simultaneously win Wimbledon and the US Open for three consecutive years. Flawless, confident and gracious, Federer is a worthy warrior whose composed play without question entitles him as the King of all Courts.
  </p>

Of course, special mention must go out to Andre Agassi, who played in his [21st consecutive](http://www.usopen.org/en_US/news/articles/2006-09-03/200609031157332395640.html "US Open 2006 - Tennis' Best Friend:  Agassi Goes Out in Glory") U.S. Open, and to Martina Navratilova, who at 49 years of age won her [59th major title](http://www.usopen.org/en_US/news/reports/2006-09-09/200609091157786921265.html "US Open 2006 - A Grand Finale to Martina's Career") (this one in mixed doubles). The event was bittersweet for both, as it marked their final appearance as competitors in the sport.
