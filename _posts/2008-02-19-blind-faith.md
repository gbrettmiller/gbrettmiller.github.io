When was the last time you changed your mind about something related to autism? If you read back through my nearly three years of posts here you&#8217;ll see that my own thoughts on the matter have fluctuated quite a bit. (Good thing I&#8217;m not a politician!). It&#8217;s not that I have trouble making up my mind, it&#8217;s just that I seem to learn something new everyday that influences my opinions.

In a post entitled [Nestor Lopez-Duran Ph.D on Autism, Science and Faith-Based Advocacy](http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2008/02/lopez-duran-phd-on-autism-science-and.html), Autism dad [Harold Doherty](http://www.blogger.com/profile/05838571980003579163), author of [Facing Autism in New Brunswick](http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/), references the following comments from Lopez-Duran:

> <span style="font-style:italic;">what I believe doesn’t really matter, because “beliefs” rapidly turn into blind faith, even amongst scientists. Instead, good science only occurs when positions are flexible and reflective only of the status of the research (data) at any given time<br /></span>  
> **Nestor L. Lopez-Duran Ph.D., [Translating Autism](http://www.translatingautism.com/),** [About Science and faith-based advocacy](http://www.translatingautism.com/2008/02/about-science-and-faith-based-advocacy.html)

Doherty goes on to provide his own thoughts:

> Many issues such as the mercury-autism, vaccine-autism, genetics-environment arguments in autism discussions purport to revolve around science but often depart from the science and embrace the faith-based advocacy referenced by Dr. Lopez-Duran. To the great detriment of anyone with an interest in understanding the nature and causes of autism.

It is very difficult to maintain this kind of cold objectivity when the subject in question is your own child. But if we, as a society, ever want to get anywhere on these questions (assuming there is somewhere to get to), this is an important lesson to keep in mind.

On a completely separate note, I will be taking a short break from posting here. You may still, however, see my name pop up in comments of other blogs. I plan to return on April 2, not coincidentally [World Autism Awareness Day](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22World+Autism+Awareness+Day%22).
