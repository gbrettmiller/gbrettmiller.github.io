Like most postings on [Pat Sullivan&#8217;s](http://www.patsullivan.com/blog) blog, [Autism on Good Morning America](http://www.patsullivan.com/blog/2005/09/autism_on_good_.html) really got me thinking. In this case, it was the last sentence that sent the wheels spinning (emphasis is Pat&#8217;s):

> Much like **TREATING** cancer, diabetes, etc., **TREATING** autism through ABA appears to be big business. **CURING** it however, yields little but vehement criticism.

What does it mean to &#8220;cure&#8221; something? From [dictionary.com](http://www.dictionary.com) is the following (as cited from the American HeritageÂ® Stedman&#8217;s Medical Dictionary):

> <a name="C0376500"></a>**cure** (ky<img align="absbottom" border="0" src="https://i1.wp.com/cache.lexico.com/dictionary/graphics/AHD4/GIF/oobreve.gif?w=640" data-recalc-dims="1" />r)  
> _n._ 
> 
>   1. Restoration of health;  
>     recovery from disease.
>   2. A method or course of treatment used to restore health.
>   3. An agent that restores health; a remedy.

The key seems to be &#8220;restore health.&#8221; For physical ailments, the meaning of this is well known and understood. 

But what does it mean in the context of a disorder that is diagnosed based on observation and behavior and is, at its most basic, simply a deviation from the societal norms of behavior and social interaction? Is &#8220;changing behavior to be normal&#8221; _[God, I hate trying to find the right words cause that one just doesn&#8217;t work]_ the same as &#8220;restoring health.&#8221; It seems to me that yes, it is. 

Of course, all this goes back to the question, &#8220;What is autism?&#8221; For if you don&#8217;t really know what the disease is, how can you say you&#8217;ve cured it. Is it possible that there is more than one cause of autism? Are autism and mercury (or heavy-metal) poisoning different problems that just happen to present the same*? Is there only one cure, or can there be several?

If, as the [transcript of the Good Morning America segment](http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=1169223&page=1) states, the boy is indistinguishable from his peers, isn&#8217;t it fair to say the ABA treatment **cured** him of autism? 

&#8211; &#8211; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212;&#8211;  
_* If you haven&#8217;t already guessed it, this is kind of what I believe._
