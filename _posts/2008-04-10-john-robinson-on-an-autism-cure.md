This is kind of a follow-up to [my most recent post](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com/2008/04/whose-decision-is-it/). In responding to [Some Asperger questions from the audience](http://jerobison.blogspot.com/2008/04/some-asperger-questions-from-audience.html), John Elder <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Robinson</span> Robison &#8211; author of the book Look Me in the Eye and [a blog of the same name](http://jerobison.blogspot.com/ "Look Me in the Eye ") &#8211; takes on the cure question:

> _If there were ever a cure would you take it, or would you think it was like taking a piece away?_At age 50, I am comfortable the way I am and I would not want to take any pieces away. As a teenager, though, life was a lot harder and Iâ€™d have had a different answer if you asked me this at age 15. I guess we become more comfortable with ourselves as we get older and hopefully wiser.

If you&#8217;ve read the book, you know that <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Robinson&#8217;s</span> Robison&#8217;s life was anything but easy. Interesting, no doubt. But not easy, especially in a time when pretty much all kids &#8211; autistic or not &#8211; were left to sink or swim in the world.

_(A side thought for a later post: Could the increased amount of time parents today spend with their kids, compared with previous generations, be a contributing factor to the increase in autism diagnoses?)_
