Though no one sets out to fail, failure is an essential aspect of learning. You can&#8217;t learn if you never fail. <span style="line-height:1.7;">But it is important to remember that failure is but a means to an end &#8211; learning &#8211; and not an end in and of itself. </span>

<span style="line-height:1.7;">Failure should not be sought out, but when it happens you should squeeze it for all it&#8217;s worth and learn what you can from it. </span>
