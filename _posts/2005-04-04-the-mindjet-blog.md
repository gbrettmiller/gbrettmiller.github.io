From the executive group (including their CEO, CTO, and VP of Bus Dev) at Mindjet is [The Mindjet Blog](http://blog.mindjet.com/), a recently launched blog addressing the technology behind and uses of their [Mind Manager](http://www.mindjet.com) application. A couple of interesting early posts include an article about using [Mind Manager as an RSS reader](http://blog.mindjet.com/2005/03/mindmanager-your-new-visual-rss-reader) and a piece on [&#8220;How Our Blog Travels Through the Blogosphere](http://blog.mindjet.com/2005/03/how-our-blog-travels-through-the-blogosphere).&#8221;

I&#8217;m looking forward to more good info from the Mindjet team. Thank guys.
