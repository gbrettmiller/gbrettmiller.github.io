A couple of articles discussing the limitation of Learning Management Systems (LMS): [

> The real issue is that LMS vendors are attempting to position their tools as the center-point for elearning &#8211; removing control from the system&#8217;s end-users: instructors and learners. Unfortunately, beginning learning with an LMS is often a matter of wrong tool for wrong purposes (which results in failed elearning implementations, ineffective learning, and unnecessary expenses). Implementing an LMS as part of a holistic learning environment gives the end user flexibility and control to move in various paths (driven by learning needs, not by LMS design).

> Learning software vendors still doggedly pursue their vision of reusable learning objects that integrate via a central standards-conformant LMS. Meanwhile, trainers who really want to encourage experience-sharing and dynamic learner-created content are scrambling to understand blogging, RSS, and peer-to-peer networks.

Much the same thing I remember from the &#8220;early days&#8221; of the KM craze, when it was all about software this, technology that &#8211; technology for technology&#8217;s sake. Technology for its own sake is meaningless. It is how people can use the technology to connect to others that makes them valuable.
