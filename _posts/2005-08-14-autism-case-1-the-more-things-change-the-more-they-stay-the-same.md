From **[Science Daily](http://www.sciencedaily.com)** is the article[The Age of Autism: Case 1 revisited](http://www.sciencedaily.com/upi/index.php?feed=Science&article=UPI-1-20050815-09441200-bc-ageofautism.xml). What struck me even more than the fact that the first identified case of autism has apparently been &#8216;cured&#8217; is the difference in opinion between a family member and a physician about how the cure came about: 

> _[Family]_ &#8216;When he was finally released (following medical treatment for juvenile arthritis), the nervous condition he was formerly afflicted with was gone,&#8217; his brother said. &#8216;The proclivity to excitability and extreme nervousness had all but cleared up, and after that he went to school and had one more little flare-up (of arthritis) when in junior college. They treated it with cortisone.&#8217;
> 
> _[Physician]_ &#8216;Donald, because of the intuitive wisdom of a tenant farmer couple, who knew how to make him utilize his futile preoccupations for practical purposes and at the same time helped him to maintain contact with his family, is a regularly employed bank teller; while living at home, he takes part in a variety of community activities and has the respect of his fellow townspeople.&#8217;

We&#8217;ve learned so much, but still know so little.
