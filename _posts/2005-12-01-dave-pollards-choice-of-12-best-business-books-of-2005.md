Dave Pollard&#8217;s list of [The 12 Best Business Books of 2005](http://blogs.salon.com/0002007/2005/12/01.html#a1357) is worth taking a look at. I&#8217;ll definitely be checking at least some of them out. 

What really struck me about his review, though, was the summary at the end of the post (emphasis is mine): 

> In general, it was another disappointing year for books about business. The lack of imagination and courage among book publishers seems to be endemic, and the approach seems almost formulaic &#8212; give us a big name cult-of-leadership CEO and let&#8217;s bask in his wisdom, or give us a book about some intriguing new management theory, but make sure it sounds like it&#8217;s been thoroughly tested out in the real world by dropping the names of familiar Fortune 500 companies who allegedly have deployed this theory &#8212; even if they really haven&#8217;t. When will publishers, and business book buyers, realize that **there are no guarantees, best practices or cookie-cutter implementation methodologies _for anything_**? We should read books to get **interesting and useful ideas**, and then draw upon our courage and the wisdom of crowds &#8212; our employees and customers especially &#8212; to decide which ideas to pursue, experiment with them, and then decide how to implement them in the unique context of our own organizations.
