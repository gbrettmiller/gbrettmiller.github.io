Jack Vinson has had several posts of late on the evils of multi-tasking and the unfortunate (yet seemingly unavoidable) and relentless march toward more and more multi-tasking. This comes from management styles, focus on action, and indeed the technologies we use.

Jack&#8217;s post today started me on a blog journey that resulted in several other worthwhile posts on the topic.

Chris Spagnuolo has an interesting article on multitasking, [The Myth of Managed Multi-tasking](http://www.chrisspagnuolo.com/2008/01/07/TheMythOfManagedMultitasking.aspx):
