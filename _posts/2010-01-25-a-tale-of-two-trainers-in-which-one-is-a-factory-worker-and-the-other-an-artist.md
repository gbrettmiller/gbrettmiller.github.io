**Trainer 1**:

Received training from one school. Her approach to training:

> This is the way I learned it, this is the way I&#8217;m teaching it to you. Don&#8217;t question me, don&#8217;t ask for anything. Just sit down, shut up, and do what I tell you. If you don&#8217;t get anything out of this training session, it&#8217;s not my fault; I&#8217;m following the training guide.

**Trainer 2**:

Actively sought training from several schools. The guidance from these different schools are often contradictory, sometimes explicitly contradictory: &#8220;That school does x, and we never ever do x.&#8221; She ignores these warnings, seeing how x from one school and y from another school can work together to provide something even better. Her approach to training:

> What are you trying to achieve with this training? Is there anything you really want to do? Is their anything that you can&#8217;t do or don&#8217;t want to do? Let me know if something doesn&#8217;t feel right or is too easy/hard. How was that workout? Next week we&#8217;ll try this and see if it works better for you.

Which trainer would you rather have? Which would you go back to?
