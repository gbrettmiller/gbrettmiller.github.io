[Das E-Business Weblog: Knowledge Management does not exist. Personal Knowledge Management does.](http://www.roell.net/weblog/archiv/2004/06/25/knowledge_management_does_not_exist_personal_knowledge_management_does.shtml)

Hmmm&#8230;.. I&#8217;m going to have to think about this one for a while. 

I am a firm believer in the idea of Personal Knowledge Management. This has been around forever, technology has simply made it different.

I also believe that Enterprise Knowledge Management exists. But it is not the knowledge of the individual members of the organization that is being managed: it is the **knowledge of the organization** that is being managed. I&#8217;ve been putting together an article/paper on this thought, based on the idea that **organizations are intelligent** themselves. Some sources for my ideas concerning intelligent organizations include **[The Genius Within: Discovering the Intelligence of Every Living Thing](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0151005516/gbrettmiller-20)**, **[Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Software](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684868768/gbrettmiller-20)**, and **[Investigations](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/019512104X/gbrettmiller-20)**. 

Slow, but sure.
