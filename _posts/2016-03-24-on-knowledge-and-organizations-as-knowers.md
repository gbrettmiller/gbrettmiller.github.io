Been giving some thought to the concept of knowledge and knowing in the context of organizations and knowledge management. These two paragraphs come from separate trains of thought, but are related so I decided to post them here together. Definitely needs a bit more reflection and development. What do you think?

The terms &#8220;tacit&#8221; and &#8220;explicit&#8221; are typically used when referring to different types of knowledge (in the context of knowledge management efforts). It seems to me that &#8220;unconscious&#8221; and &#8220;conscious&#8221; might be more appropriate / accurate? In that explicit knowledge is that of which you are consciously aware of while tacit knowledge is that which lies &#8220;below the surface&#8221; and which you use without having to be aware you are using it. Need to cross reference this with what I&#8217;ve been learning about [Liminal Thinking](http://liminalthinking.com/)&#8230;.

On the subject of &#8220;knowers&#8221;, could the organization itself be considered a &#8220;knower&#8221;? Not the sum total of the knowledge that resides in its members or files, but a knowing that emerges from the connections and interactions of that knowledge. If so, how would that change how we approach KM?
