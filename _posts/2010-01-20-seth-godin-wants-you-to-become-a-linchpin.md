When I was young, I went to see Raiders of the Lost Ark with my mom. At the conclusion of the opening sequence, as Indy&#8217;s escape plane flies away, my mom leaned over and said, &#8220;Oh my God. Is the whole movie going to be like this?&#8221; I had a very similar feeling when &#8211; on page 20 of his new book [Linchpin: Are You Indispensable?](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591843162?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1591843162)<img style="border:none !important;margin:0!important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=gbrettmiller-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1591843162" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> &#8211; [Seth Godin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Godin) asks the reader for &#8220;one last favor before you start&#8230;&#8221;

&#8220;Before I start? Is the rest of the book going to be like this?!?&#8221;

Divided into 13 chapters, each chapter is made up of a large number of small sections, very few of which are longer than a page; one section clocked in at just one word (even though the section title is 52 words long). Though related to the chapters that hold them, these little sections seem almost like a stream of consciousness of questions and answers, insights and mandates. To risk another pop-culture metaphor, I felt at times like I was inside a Robin Williams improv routine; as soon as one idea comes out, another is liberated and thrown out into the mix.

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-965" style="margin:10px;" title="Linchpin after my first read through" src="https://i2.wp.com/blog.gbrettmiller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010-01-18-16.35.50-300x224.jpg?resize=240%2C179" alt="" width="240" height="179" align="right" data-recalc-dims="1" />](http://nostraightlines.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/2010-01-18-16-35-50.jpg)I like this book. Or, more accurately, I like the ideas in this book. On my first read through the book I chose to dog-ear pages instead of my usual of writing in the margins. This picture shows the results of my dog-ears.

In just over 200+ pages, Seth Godin asks, explores, and answers many of the ideas questions that have been on my mind lately, especially as it relates to work and the possibility of work as art. I&#8217;ve been considering this not just for myself but for my sons, one a junior and the other a senior in high school. This book is a must read for anyone considering their own future, or what to tell their kids about how they can live their own lives.

There are many themes and ideas within this book that different people will lock onto. I have the feeling that I will be exploring the ideas in the book for many weeks to come. For me, though, the two that jumped out were the discussions of &#8220;Indoctrination: How we got here&#8221; and &#8220;The Resistance&#8221;.

The former explains how we have all &#8211; or nearly all &#8211; become &#8220;factory workers&#8221; and compares this with what we are capable of &#8211; art. The latter exposes the &#8220;scaredy cat&#8221; (my term, not his) inside our brains &#8211; our lizard brains. This part of our brain was very effective &#8211; and very essential &#8211; in our survival and evolution, but now is getting in our way. The key to overcoming any adversary is a knowledge of that adversary, and he gives us an excellent understanding of this particular one.

Earlier I mentioned an especially short section with an unusually long section title. As it turns out, that section &#8211; title and all &#8211; really sums up the entire book for me:

> **&#8220;Wait! Are You Saying That I Have to Stop Following Instructions and Start Being an Artist? Someone Who Dreams Up New Ideas and Makes Them Real? Someone Who Finds New Ways to Interact, New Pathways to Deliver Emotion, New Ways to Connect? Someone Who Acts Like a Human, Not a Cog? Me?&#8221;**
> 
> Yes.

By the time you finish reading Linchpin, you will believe that you can do all of this. All you have to do, as Seth reminds us again and again, is to make the choice.
