[Harold Jarche](http://www.jarche.com) has an interesting set of posts discussing the role of curriculum in public school education, and the impact it can/does have on our children. In [a post today](http://www.jarche.com/?p=1506 "Harold Jarche - On curriculum"), Harold explains his issues with public school curriculum:

> My issue is first that the public school curriculum, as it is implemented, is based on **subjects** and not **processes** (e.g. critical thinking; research methods; logic; etc). Secondly, I know from experience that the NB Department of Education does not have a process by which its subject-based curriculum is developed. Basically, a number of &#8220;experts&#8221; are put in a room for a week and when it&#8217;s over they have developed a curriculum. It is a rather black art. There are no first principles on which a subject&#8217;s curriculum is based so one cannot go back and determine if the subject is still relevant, if it ever was.
> 
> Curriculum, as currently practised, constrains learners, as there is no room for exploration because the teachers must cover what&#8217;s on the curriculum. This is the flaw in being subject-based. If education were process-based, then teachers could facilitate learning using a variety of subject areas. Why should I learn about history when I am more interested in art? Can&#8217;t I learn critical thinking in either discipline? Such an approach would mean **giving up control**, and that of course is **the real issue**.

The emphasis there at the end is mine. This is a recurring theme from the industrial age, which is all about control, that we need to overcome so we can move into the information age.
