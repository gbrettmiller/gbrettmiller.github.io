If you are a regular reader of this blog, you know that one of my big interests is in the area of Personal [Knowledge Management](http://www.workliteracy.com/work-literacy-launched), or PKM. _(Note: as I went to insert a link to the PKM category of this blog, I discovered that I don&#8217;t, in fact, have one. Thus the link to the KM category.)_ Key to this is an interest in and exploration of the various [tools](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/category/tools) available today to help individuals improve their ability to perform their work.

Thanks to a [post from Harold Jarche](http://www.jarche.com/2008/06/the-work-literacy-gap/), I now have a term that very neatly (and concisely) describes what my interest really is: [Work Literacy](http://www.workliteracy.com/about). From the [inaugural post](http://www.workliteracy.com/work-literacy-launched) at Work Literacy:

> Work Literacy is based on the beliefs that:
> 
>   * With the growth of new technologies, explosion of new information, and accessibility of experts around the world, there’s a growing gap between the skills that most knowledge workers possess and the resources available to them.
>   * As knowledge workers we need practical skills, methods and tools that will improve our effectiveness and help us stay on top of our game.
>   * This is an issue that’s evolving quickly and we need a way to start discussing the implications, sharing ideas and learning how to better manage our work and learning.
> 
> Work Literacy will:
> 
>   * Inspire action
>   * Pull together a wide variety of individuals who will collectively help provide content that is meaningful to the “average knowledge worker.”
>   * Provide a hub for the discussion of this topic by knowledge workers.
>   * Provide access to resources such as workshop providers, presenters, information, etc. offered by people in the network.

This one is definitely going into my feed reader, you should take a look at it as well. _(And yes, I am also setting up a **Work Literacy** category.)_
