This is true whether the knowledge worker commands advanced knowledge, like a surgeon, or simple and fairly elementary knowledge, like a junior accountant. In either case it is the knowledge investment that determines whether the employee is productive or not, more than the tools, machines, and capital furnished by an organization. The industrial worker needed the capitalist infinitely more than the capitalist needed the industrial worker&#8211;the basis for Marx&#8217;s assertion that there would always be a surplus of industrial workers, an &#8220;industrial reserve army,&#8221; that would make sure that wages could not possibly rise above the subsistence level (probably Marx&#8217;s most egregious error). **In the knowledge society the most probable assumption for organizations&#8211;and certainly the assumption on which they have to conduct their affairs&#8211;is that they need knowledge workers far more than knowledge workers need them.**
