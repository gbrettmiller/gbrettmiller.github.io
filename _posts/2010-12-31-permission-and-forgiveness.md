&#8220;Do you really think George bothered to ask for f\***ing permission?&#8221;

This was Kevin Spacey&#8217;s response to a question from the audience during the Q&A following the St. Louis premiere of George Hickenlooper&#8217;s movie &#8220;Casino Jack&#8221; at the St. Louis Film Festival. This specific question was related to getting legal clearance for the music used in the film, but it reflected a general theme of the evening as friends and family honored George &#8211; a high school classmate of mine &#8211; following his sudden death only two weeks before this hometown premiere.

In addition to numerous stories of guerilla filmmaking on the set of Casino Jack (like the scene filmed at the Capitol), friends old and new described George&#8217;s lack of concern for obtaining permission to do things. My favorite was a story told by Mike Beugg about the making of George&#8217;s first, sadly long lost, feature length movie. As the roller coaster (Screaming Eagle) pulled into the station, and passengers were screaming because of the knife and the blood, George was calmly reassuring everyone that &#8220;it&#8217;s OK, we&#8217;re making a movie.&#8221;

When asked, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell anyone?&#8221;, he responded, &#8220;I wanted to get real reactions.&#8221;

Not only had George not asked permission to do this, he wasn&#8217;t even asking forgiveness.

A few days later I came across Chris Guillebeau&#8217;s book The Art of Non-Conformity. With the above thoughts about George still fresh in my mind, I picked up the book and read it (devoured it?) in a couple of hours. What Chris had to say made sense to me on an intellectual level, but it was my recent evening with the legacy of George Hickenlooper that really brought it home, really made an impact.

As Chris tells us, and George showed us, it may be better to ask forgiveness than permission, but most of the time you don&#8217;t need either.

Something to think about as we head into the new year.
