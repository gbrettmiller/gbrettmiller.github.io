While Ian was looking through the different options, my eyes were drawn to the shelf of instructional DVDs. One in particular caught my eye, [Mike Portnoy](http://www.mikeportnoy.com/ "Mike Portnoy.com - The Official Website")&#8216;s [Liquid Drum Theater](http://astore.amazon.com/gbrettmiller-20/detail/B00005RYOX/105-0704870-6814832 "amazon:  Mike Portnoy - Liquid Drum Theater"). Though I didn&#8217;t buy the DVD, the info on the jacket made me want to learn more about Portnoy&#8217;s music with various groups. The group that stuck in my mind was [Liquid Tension Experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_Tension_Experiment "wikipedia:  Liquid Tension Experiment") (with such a cool name, how could it not).

I&#8217;m always on the prowl for good new music, preferably good instrumental rock, and what I found with Liquid Tension Experiment on their two, aptly titled, CDs &#8211; [Liquid Tension Experiment](http://astore.amazon.com/gbrettmiller-20/detail/B0000067YK/105-0704870-6814832 "amazon:  Liquid Tension Experiment") and [Liquid Tension Experiment 2](http://astore.amazon.com/gbrettmiller-20/detail/B00000J7UT/105-0704870-6814832 "amazon:  Liquid Tension Experiment 2") &#8211; didn&#8217;t disappoint me. After listening to a couple of 30 second excerpts on the iTunes store, these two albums very quickly made their way into my collection of songs. (I&#8217;d have provided links to the albums in the iTunes store, but I&#8217;m not sure you can actually do that in a browser.)

To say that these guys are good would be a gross understatement, so I was anxious to see what else they had put out. Turns out that Liquid Tension Experiment was kind of a &#8216;side-gig&#8217; for Portnoy and others, so they only released the two CDs mentioned above. As an &#8216;experiment,&#8217; I would say that they definitely succeeded.

If you don&#8217;t want to buy both full albums but want to get a good sample of what they&#8217;ve got to offer, I&#8217;d recommend Paradigm Shift or Freedom of Speech from the first album, and Acid Rain or Biaxident from the second. You&#8217;ll be glad you did.
