I know the [story of Jason McElwain](http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/newyork/ny-bc-ny--hoopshero0228feb28,0,725754.story?coll=ny-region-apnewyork) has been around the world and back again by now, but I couldn&#8217;t help but print this quote from him:

> &#8216;I&#8217;m not really that different,&#8217; he said. &#8216;I don&#8217;t really care about this autistic situation, really. <span style="font-weight:bold;">It&#8217;s just the way I am.</span> The advice I&#8217;d give to autistic people is just keep working, just keep dreaming, you&#8217;ll get your chance and you&#8217;ll do it.&#8217;

Good advice for anyone, autistic or not.
