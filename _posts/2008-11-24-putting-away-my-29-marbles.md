I think this has been a long time coming, but it is finally time to retire the blog &#8220;29 Marbles.&#8221;  There are several reasons behind this decision, but the biggest is that I&#8217;m tired of writing about autism separately from everything else, as if it is something apart from the rest of my life.  It&#8217;s not.

I&#8217;ll still be writing about autism, with the same random frequency as I do here, on a new blog I&#8217;ve started called [Theoria cum Praxi](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com).  Here is the [direct link to the autism category](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/category/autism/).  If you subscribe to the RSS feed and want to continue to receive updates, you don&#8217;t have to do anything.  I&#8217;ll be updating the feed info at Feedburner within the next couple of days.  Of course, feel free to subscribe to the full feed at [http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheoriaCumPraxi](http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheoriacumPraxi).  This new blog will also fill in for the also retired [No Straight Lines](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com), so I will be addressing the life/work topics from there as well.

I hope to see you all there.
