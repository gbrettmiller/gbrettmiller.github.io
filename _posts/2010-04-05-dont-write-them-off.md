Seth Godin doesn&#8217;t write about autism, and yet much of what he writes and says comes across as if it were written just for the parents of an autistic child. Today&#8217;s article &#8211; [Accepting limits](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/04/accepting-limits.html) &#8211; from his blog is a perfect example (emphasis is mine):

> Isn&#8217;t it **absurd to focus so much energy on &#8216;practical&#8217; skills that prep someone for a life of following instructions** but relentlessly avoid the difficult work necessary to push someone to reinvent themselves into becoming someone who makes a difference?
> 
> And isn&#8217;t it even **worse to write off a person** or an organization merely because of what they are **instead of what they might become**?

Much of what counts as autism intervention these days focuses on making the child &#8211; or the adult &#8211; [&#8220;more normal&#8221; or &#8220;less autistic&#8221;](http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/autism-and-drive/). Â Granted there are things that autistic people need to be taught and understand so they can function in the world, there is no denying that. But this doesn&#8217;t mean that their uniqueness should be driven out of them in the process.

Don&#8217;t write off your child&#8217;s future &#8211; or worse, your child &#8211; just because they are autistic. There is great potential there, if you are willing to do the work necessary to uncover it.
