In [Information wants to be free, but you still have to protect it](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/2007/information-wants-to-be-free-but-you-still-need-to-protect-it "No Straight Lines:  Information wants to be free..."), I talked about [Bruce Schneier](http://www.schneier.com/ "Bruce Schneier")&#8216;s recommendation to encrypt an entire disk instead of just your key files.  But sometimes you want to protect your key files as well, either on your system drive, an external hard drive, or a USB thumb drive.  

[TrueCrypt](http://www.truecrypt.org/ "TrueCrypt:  Free Open-Source On-The-Fly Encryption") is one option for this and, as [Lifehacker tells us today](http://feeds.gawker.com/~r/lifehacker/full/~3/230413368/truecrypt-now-available-for-mac-too "Lifehacker:  TrueCrypt Now Available for Mac, Too"), it now supports Mac OS in addition to Windows and Linux.  For more on how to install and use TrueCrypt on Windows, check out [this Lifehacker article](http://lifehacker.com/software/top/geek-to-live--encrypt-your-data-178005.php "Lifehacker:  Geek to live - Encrypt your data").
