It may not show here, but I have been giving quite a bit of thought to autism and related concerns lately (it is, after all, IEP season). I&#8217;ve not written here, though, mainly due to numerous other commitments over the last couple of months. One of those commitments has been setting up the new blog, [The Tramp and Tumble Blog](http://trampandtumble.blogspot.com). 

My younger son is on the [St. Louis Elite](http://www.gatewaykidsworld.com/team.html) team, and the National Championships are quickly approaching. As much as we love it, though, [Trampoline and Tumbling](http://www.usa-gymnastics.org/tt) is not well known as a competitive activity (unlike rival activities Gymnastics [which TnT is actually a subset of] and cheerleading), so I&#8217;ve been working with the coach at St. Louis Elite to help spread the word. [Tramp and Tumble](http://trampandtumble.blogspot.com) is a first step.

Trampoline has long been a part of our household. We found, as many autism parents do, that the trampoline is incredibly valuable to our autistic children. We couldn&#8217;t get by without it. (And, yes, we&#8217;ve spent many a cold morning &#8220;shoveling&#8221; the trampoline after we finish the driveway!) Having the trampoline around is also what led our youngest into the sport, so it has worked out all around.

_For a little more on the joy of tumbling, and the joy of coaching, with a bit of autism flavor, check out [these posts from Kassiane](http://rettdevil.blogspot.com/search?q=tumbling)._
