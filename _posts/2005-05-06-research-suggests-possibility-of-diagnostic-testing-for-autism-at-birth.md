More on biological basis of autism and the potential for diagnosing autism at birth. 

[Research suggests possibility of diagnostic testing for autism at birth](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nationworld/bal-te.autism06may06,1,6365355.story?coll=bal-nationworld-headlines): 

> The findings &#8216;suggest the possibility for future diagnostic tests for autism at birth&#8217; and might mean that &#8216;we can get children into effective treatment much earlier than is now possible,&#8217; said Dr. Helen Tager-Flusberg of the Boston University School of Medicine, who chaired the fourth International Meeting for Autism Research in Boston, where the research was reported.
> 
> Studies suggest that researchers are beginning to tease out the biological and developmental causes of the disabling disorder&#8230;.
