From my [M. C. Escher](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/m._c._escher "M. C. Escher - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia") calendar:

> Any schoolboy with a little aptitude can perhaps draw better than I; but what he lacks in most cases is that tenacious desire to make it reality, that obstinate gnashing of the teeth and saying, &#8220;Although I know it can&#8217;t be done, I want to do it anyway.&#8221;

This brings to mind a passage from [John Derbyshire](http://olimu.com/ "John Derbyshire's Home Page")&#8216;s book [Prime Obsession](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/0452285259&tag=gbrettmiller-20&camp=1789&creative=9325 "Prime Obsession - amazon.com"), a combined biography of [Bernhard Riemann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann "Bernhard Riemann - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia") and history of attempts to solve his famous [hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis "Riemann hypothesis - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"):

    [David] <a title="David Hilbert - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert">Hilbert</a> believed firmly in the unbounded power of the human mind to uncover the truths of Nature and mathematics. In his youth, the rather pessimistic theories of the French philosopher <a title="Emil du Bois-Reymond - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_du_Bois-Reymond">Emil du Bois-Reymond</a> had been very popular. Du Bois-Reymond maintained that certain things &#8211; the nature of matter and of human consciousness, for example &#8211; are intrinsically unknowable. He coined the apothegm <em>ignoramus et ignorabimus</em> &#8211; &#8220;we are ignorant and we shall remain ignorant.&#8221; Hilbert had never liked this gloomy philosophy. &#8230;

  <blockquote title="Naturekennen und Logik (mp3, in original German)" cite="http://math.sfsu.edu/smith/Documents/HilbertRadio/HilbertRadio.mp3">
    <p>
      We ought not believe those who today, with a philosophical air and a tone of superiority, prophesy the decline of culture, and are smug in their acceptance of the <em>Ignorabimus</em> principle. For us there is no <em>Ignorabimus</em>, and in my opinion there is none for the natural sciences either. In place of this foolish <em>Ignorabimus</em>, let our resolution be, to the contrary: &#8220;We must know, we shall know.&#8221;

As I&#8217;ve mentioned before, desire and passion (and a touch of obsession) are key to achieving mastery, and accomplishing things that no one else thinks is even possible.
