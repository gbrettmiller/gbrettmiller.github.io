&#8230;or strategy by default? Where do you stand?

Do things just happen to you, are you just along for the ride? Are you getting where you want to go, or are you simply getting where you are going? A couple of old proverbs (I forget where from):  


> If you don&#8217;t know where you are going, any road will get you there.
> 
> -and-
> 
> If you stay on the road you are on, you will end up where it takes you.
