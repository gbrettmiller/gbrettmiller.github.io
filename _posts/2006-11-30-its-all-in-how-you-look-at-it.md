As our first winter storm approaches, I&#8217;m reminded of something I heard many (many) years ago:

> There is no such thing as bad weather; only inappropriate clothing.

Though I don&#8217;t remember exactly when or where I first heard that, I do know it was from my younger days when I was doing more climbing, backpacking, and camping. Though at first glance it seems to be just another silly saying, in the context of outdoor activities it is all too true and is a key part of the mastery of any of these activities. One of the things that mastery of anything requires is the ability to properly prepare so that you can perform at your best.

Which brings up another short aphorism addressing the importance of preparedness:

> If you find yourself in a fair fight, you didn&#8217;t plan it properly.

Have you found yourself in any fair &#8220;fights&#8221; lately?
