Written by [Hugh MacLeod](http://gapingvoid.com/about/) of [gapingvoid.com](http://www.gapingvoid.com), it is made up of [40 short essays](http://gapingvoid.com/books/ "A list of most of the essays and excerpt of some...") that each dive into a very specific idea or question. And pictures, lots of pictures from the [cube-grenade](http://gapingvoid.com/2009/05/25/httpgapingvoid-com20090525now-accepting-private-commissions-for-moleskines-and-cube-grenades/) gallery at gapingvoid.com.

Based on many years of experience, the advice that MacLeod dispenses is almost brutal in its description of what aspiring artists (used in the loosest, Seth Godin-esque way) have to look forward to, and what they have to do to get there. Just reading the essay titles gives you an idea of what to expect:

  * Put the hours in
  * If your business plan depends on suddenly being &#8220;discovered&#8221; by some bit shot, your plan will probably fail
  * Keep your day job
  * Selling out is harder than it looks

If you are looking for an &#8220;easy ticket&#8221; to success, this isn&#8217;t the book that will get you there. (Hint: such a book doesn&#8217;t exist.)

None of this is new, of course, to those who are interested in pursuing mastery and are willing to put in the effort it takes to achieve that mastery. Who aren&#8217;t focused on a specific outcome but are interested in the journey on which they find themselves. There is plenty in the book to reinforce the importance of that attitude:

  * Don&#8217;t try to stand out from the crowd; avoid crowds altogether
  * Sing in your own voice
  * Worrying about &#8220;Commercial vs. Artistic&#8221; is a complete waste of time
  * Write from the heart
  * The best way to get approval is not to need it

In some ways, this book simply tells us what most of already know. Maybe we know it subconsciously, just under the radar of what we are willing to acknowledge. Maybe we know that it is true but just can&#8217;t bring ourselves to do anything about it. But as MacLeod lays out in the opening essay:

> GOOD IDEAS ALTER THE POWER BALANCE IN RELATIONSHIPS. THAT IS WHY GOOD IDEAS ARE ALWAYS INITIALLY RESISTED.
> 
> Good ideas come with a heavy burden, which why so few people execute them. So few people can handle it.

[**Ignore Everybody**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159184259X?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=159184259X ": and 39 Other Keys to Creativity")<img style="border:none !important;margin:0!important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=gbrettmiller-20&l=as2&o=1&a=159184259X" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> simply lays it out on the table to where you can&#8217;t ignore it, where you have to decide for yourself, &#8220;Can I handle it?&#8221;<figure style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
