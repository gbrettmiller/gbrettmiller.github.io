Back in January I started the process of [remodeling 29 Marble](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com/2008/01/blog-business/)s, and today I announce the completion of that remodeling (to the extent that any blog is ever really complete). A couple of things you will likely notice:

  * 29 Marbles has moved from its home on [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com/) its own address at [http://autism.gbrettmiller.com](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com//), and I&#8217;ve switched from [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com/) to [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org/). I did this for several reasons, but mostly I was [taking my own advice to &#8220;own my data&#8221;](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/2007/who-owns-your-data-who-should-own-it).
  * The feed for 29 Marbles is still <http://feeds.feedburner.com/29Marbles>, so you should not lose your subscription. (I think you may have received a feed &#8220;refresh&#8221; of the last few posts, but that should be OK.)
  * The left hand column is for information related directly to 29 Marbles, such as the search function, feed subscription, and category lists.
  * The right hand column includes feeds from and links to other autism related resources. Although I definitely have my own opinion about certain things, I also think it is important to see others&#8217; views. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve included feeds to the [Autism Hub](http://www.autism-hub.co.uk/) and [Age of Autism](http://www.ageofautism.com/), along with links to blogs by parents and autistics from I expect that this side will continue to grow.

I hope you&#8217;ll continue to read 29 Marbles and offer the great comments and discussions that arise from the very important topic of autism, what it means, and where we&#8217;re going. See you on April 2.
