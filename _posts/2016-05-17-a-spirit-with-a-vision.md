Some inspiration for the day.

<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"></span>

&nbsp;

_Hold your fire —  
Keep it burning bright  
Hold the flame  
‘Til the dream ignites —  
A spirit with a vision  
Is a dream with a mission_

I hear their passionate music  
Read the words  
That touch my heart  
I gaze at their feverish pictures  
The secrets that set them apart

When I feel the powerful visions  
Their fire has made alive  
I wish I had that instinct —  
I wish I had that drive  
_  
Spirits fly on dangerous missions  
Imaginations on fire  
Focused high on soaring ambitions  
Consumed in a single desire_

_In the grip  
Of a nameless possession —  
A slave to the drive of obsession —  
A spirit with a vision  
Is a dream with a mission…_

I watch their images flicker  
Bringing light to a lifeless screen  
I walk through  
Their beautiful buildings  
And I wish I had their dreams

But dreams don’t need  
To have motion  
To keep their spark alive  
Obsession has to have action —  
Pride turns on the drive  
_  
It’s cold comfort  
To the ones without it  
To know how they struggled —  
How they suffered about it_

If their lives were  
Exotic and strange  
They would likely have  
Gladly exchanged them  
For something a little more plain  
Maybe something a little more sane

_We each pay a fabulous price  
For our visions of paradise  
But a spirit with a vision  
Is a dream with a mission…_
