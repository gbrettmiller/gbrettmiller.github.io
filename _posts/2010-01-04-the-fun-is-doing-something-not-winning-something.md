Sell out crowds. Overflow rooms. Young fans looking for autographs after a ‘performance.’ Not things usually associated with a lecturer talking about prime numbers. But such was the case back in January 2007 for [2006 Field’s Medal](http://www.mathunion.org/medals/2006/) winner [Terence Tao](http://www.math.ucla.edu/~tao/). The New York Times article [Scientist at Work – Terence Tao – Journeys to the Distant Fields of Prime](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/13/science/13prof.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5087&em&en=df354229c0e02e42&ex=1173931200) gives a profile of this young, talented mathematician, described as a ‘rock star’ and the ‘Mozart of math.’

[<img title="Terence Tao" src="https://i1.wp.com/graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2007/03/13/science/tao.190.1.jpg?resize=190%2C206" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="190" height="206" align="right" data-recalc-dims="1" />](http://www.math.ucla.edu/~tao/)Though Tao is obviously quite gifted (an understatement), the description of his childhood, and how his parents handled his talent, is very telling as well. _[emphasis is mine]_

> [Terry&#8217;s father] Billy Tao knew the trajectories of child prodigies like Jay Luo, who graduated with a mathematics degree from Boise State University in 1982 at the age of 12, but who has since vanished from the world of mathematics.
> 
> “I **initially thought** Terry would be just like one of them, to graduate as early as possible,” he said. But after talking to experts on education for gifted children, **he changed his mind**.
> 
> His parents decided **not to push him** into college full time, so he split his time between high school and Flinders University, the local university in Adelaide. He finally enrolled as a full-time college student at Flinders when he was 14, **two years after he would have graduated** had his parents pushed him only according to his academic abilities.
> 
> The Taos had different challenges in raising their other two sons, although all three excelled in math. Trevor, two years younger than Terry, is autistic with top-level chess skills and the musical savant gift to play back on the piano a musical piece — even one played by an entire orchestra — after hearing it just once. He completed a Ph.D. in mathematics and now works for the Defense Science and Technology Organization in Australia.
> 
> The youngest, Nigel, told his father that he was “not another Terry,” and **his parents let him learn at a less accelerated pace**. Nigel, with degrees in economics, math and computer science, now works as a computer engineer for Google Australia.

What really caught my eye in the article, though, was Billy Tao’s summary of how they approached their kids’ learning:

> All along, we tend to emphasize the joy of learning. **The fun is doing something, not winning something.**

Words to live by.
