Along the lines of my recent post [Thoughts on curing autism](http://29marbles.blogspot.com/2005/04/thoughts-on-curing-autism.html) is a piece from [about.com](http://autism.about.com) titled [How About NOT Curing Autism?](http://autism.about.com/b/a/135315.htm):

> Autism has always had more than its share of conflict. Disagreements and debates over causes and treatments are old news. The new debate?  
>  
> Is an autism spectrum disorder a &#8216;way of life,&#8217; or is it an illness/disability/disorder?

The links are well worth following, and lead to an even wider array of links and discussion. No easy answers.

It goes without saying (IMHO) that we should dedicate whatever resources we can to figuring out the causes of autism, as well as a cure. The question of whether or not autistic people should be forced to accept that cure for themselves is, however, a bit stickier.
