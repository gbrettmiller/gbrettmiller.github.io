One of my [earliest blog posts](http://gbrettmiller.com/2003/06/09/check-it-out/) was a simple reference to **complex adaptive systems**. The concept was (is) fascinating to me, on many levels. Not the least of which is my [unquenchable curiosity about the connectedness of everything](http://gbrettmiller.com/2009/11/26/happy-birthday-dad/), and an early realization that the world can be seen as a collection of systems. A systems thinker, in other words.

I think I first came across the formal concept of systems thinking in **The Fifth Discipline**. I was a young Army officer in the Signal Corps, responsible for leading and training young soldiers and for planning and executing communications support missions. Many of my colleagues approached the role from a very rigid, very structured, very &#8220;mechanical&#8221; perspective. Not unexpected, of course, since military units in general are very highly structured and driven from the top down by command and control &#8211; &#8220;Here&#8217;s what you should do, and I&#8217;m going to watch you to make sure you do it so we achieve this very specific outcome.&#8221;

As if anything ever works out the way you [plan](http://gbrettmiller.com/2010/03/22/the-futility-and-value-of-planning/). Understanding my job, the role of my unit, as a component of a larger system that could be manipulated helped me to provide the best support I could to the units that depended on what we provided. (The beginnings, perhaps, of my understanding and application of user-centered design and service design, perhaps?)

I really don&#8217;t remember what triggered my interest in complexity. This, I think, is something that has always lingered just below the surface in my mind. If I had to pinpoint a single starting point for the beginning of my slow hunch about complexity it would have to be Douglas Hofstadter&#8217;s [Godel, Escher, Bach &#8211; A Golden Eternal Braid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach). I came across this book in my latter years of high school and made my way through it as best I could. Though I didn&#8217;t really understand much of it at the time, it primed my thinking to be more receptive to a different way of viewing the world.

Then came James Gleick&#8217;s [Chaos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos:_Making_a_New_Science) and Michael Crichton&#8217;s [Jurassic Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park). My interest in the science and philosophy of [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) led me to [Murray Gell-Mann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Gell-Mann) and the [Santa Fe Institute](https://www.santafe.edu/). Eventually I found my way to the work of [Dave Snowden](http://cognitive-edge.com/) and his insights into the application of systems thinking and complexity science to the world of work, however broadly or narrowly you might define this. (Though I have some of this documented in my notebooks from the time (90&#8217;s), I wish I had been blogging back then so I had a better record of my thinking.)

Systems thinking and complexity have thus spent a lot of time in my mind, side by side as I try to make sense of them and understand how to apply them to life and work. To be sure, I have often simply treated them as &#8220;basically the same thing&#8221;, without much effort to distinguish between them. Though they share some key characteristics they are, of course, different. But what are those differences, and why does it matter? Heading in to the new year seems to be a good time to delve into this.

Fortunately for me in this regard, I [recently discovered](http://gbrettmiller.com/2016/12/31/5-differences-between-complexity-systems-thinking-more-beyond/) an article from 2013 by [Sonja Blignaut](https://twitter.com/sonjabl) that has pointed me down a good path for this exploration. Titled appropriately enough [5 Differences between complexity & systems thinking](http://www.morebeyond.co.za/5-differences-between-complexity-systems-thinking/), the article is a summary of her notes and thoughts from some time spent with Dave Snowden as he presented workshops and worked with clients.

In the coming days I&#8217;ll be looking at those 5 differences in detail.
