> Early in my life, my mentor explained to me the three paths that lead to the creation of knowledge. The **analytical** path, where philosophers reflect, meditate, and make sense of objects and events; the **empirical** path, where scientists manipulate variables and conduct controlled experiments to validate reliable principles; and the **pragmatic** path where practitioners struggle with real-world challenges and come up with strategies for effective and efficient performance.

I think we&#8217;ve all been down each of these paths at various times in our lives and careers, the challenge is to understand how these paths intertwine to get us where we are trying to go.
