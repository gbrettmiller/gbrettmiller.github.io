This is the third of three posts of excerpts from [Elizabeth Moon](http://www.elizabethmoon.com/)&#8216;s novel [The Speed of Dark](http://www.speedofdark-thebook.com/). (Part one &#8211; [How normal are normal people?](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com/2008/08/how-normal-are-normal-peoplehow-normal-are-normal-people), and part two &#8211; [What does it meant to be &#8220;me&#8221;?](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com/2008/08/what-does-it-mean-to-be-me))

In this excerpt, Lou is considering what it might mean to be &#8220;healed&#8221;:

> If my self definition is limited and rule-dictated, at least it is my self-definition, and not someone else&#8217;s. I like peppers on pizza and I do not like anchovies on pizza. If someone changes me, will I still like peppers and not anchovies on pizza? What if the someone who changes me wants me to want anchovies&#8230;can they change that?

> Asking if I want to be healed is like asking if I want to like anchovies. I cannot imagine what liking anchovies would feel like, what taste they would have in my mouth. People who like anchovies tell me they taste good; people who are normal tell me being normal feels good. They cannot describe the taste or the feeling in a way that makes sense to me.
> 
> Do I need to be healed? Who does it hurt if I am not healed? Myself, but only if I feel bad the way i am, and I do not feel bad except when people say that I am not one of them, not normal. Supposedly autistic persons do not care what others think of them, but this is not true. I do care, and it hurts when people do not like me because I am autistic.

As I finished up my initial draft of this, I came across Estee&#8217;s post [What do we think we know?](http://joyofautism.blogspot.com/2008/08/what-do-we-think-we-know.html) We know what it is like to be us, we know how to do things, we just can&#8217;t always explain it.

Hopefully I&#8217;ll have my full review done by the end of this (thankfully long) weekend.
