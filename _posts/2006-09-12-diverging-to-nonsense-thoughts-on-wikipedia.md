Will [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.com "Wikipedia") converge into a useful encyclopedia, or will it diverge to nonsense?  That is one of the central questions discussed in [a story](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6051103 "NPR Morning Edition - Wikipedia Wins Users and Critics") I heard yesterday morning on [NPR](http://www.npr.org "NPR - National Public Radio")&#8216;s [Morning Edition](http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=3&agg=0&prgDate=09-11-2006&view=storyview "NPR Morning Edition - 11 September 2006").  An interesting story to listen to if you are interested in where Wikipedia is going, though for those who are already familiar there may not be a whole lot of new info.  One &#8216;a-ha&#8217; moment for me was the observation (paraphrased), &#8220;If the community of people who volunteer and maintain Wikipedai breaks down, the Wikipedia will turn into a wasteland of spam, porn, etc.&#8221;

The NPR story also touched on &#8211; but didn&#8217;t delve into &#8211; the question of whether Wikipedia should try to be a &#8220;legitimate&#8221; encyclopedia, focusing on only things that a legitimate encyclopedia woud address, or a repository of whatever information users want to post there.  For more information on that debate, check out [Deletionists, inclusionists, and delusionists](http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2006/09/a_fork_in_wikip.php "Rough Type:  Nicholas Carr's Blog") from Nicholas Carr.
