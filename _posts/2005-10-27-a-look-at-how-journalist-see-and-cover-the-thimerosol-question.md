One of my favorite shows on [National Public Radio](http://www.npr.org/) is the [WNYC](http://www.wnyc.org/) produced [On the Media](http://www.onthemedia.org/), which covers how the media covers and treats the various news stories of the week. In this vein is an article from the [Columbia Journalism Review](http://www.cjr.org/), posted [in its entirety](http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2005/10/columbia-journalism-review-on.html) at Ginger&#8217;s [Adventures in Autism](http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/), entitled <span style="font-weight:bold;">Drug Test</span>, by Daniel Schulman. 

If you are at all interested in how/why the thimerosol issue is covered the way it is, you should read this article. If you&#8217;re trying to find justification for either point of view, however, this is not the source you&#8217;re looking for. While it does address the results and validity (or not) of various studies, this article itself passes no judgement either way.

The bottom line, at least what I got out of it, is that most reporters and news organizations are scared &#8211; yep, that&#8217;s the right word &#8211; to even give space to the thimerosol question, much less report any supporting evidence in anything approaching a positive light. 

A striking example from the recent news: As [Pat Sullivan posted](http://www.patsullivan.com/blog/2005/10/fish_and_health.html) yesterday, [USA Today had a story](http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2005-10-25-mercury-fish_x.htm) concerning the health benefits, and mercury risks, of eating fish. No where in the article is autism even mentioned.

_Update: The article is also [available on the Columbia Journalism Review site](http://www.cjr.org/issues/2005/6/schulman.asp)._
