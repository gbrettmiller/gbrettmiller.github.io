For the runners in the group, if you can make it to Eatontown, NJ (Monmouth County) on September 18 make sure you check out the [ECI School for Children 5K](https://www.sfconline.org/Application.aspx). This was Zeke&#8217;s school until very recently (when we moved to St. Louis), and I can&#8217;t say enough good things about the school and its various programs. If I wasn&#8217;t half-way across the country, you can bet I would be there (even though my running times aren&#8217;t quite what they used to be!!)

If you do make it to the run, I&#8217;d love to hear how it goes.
