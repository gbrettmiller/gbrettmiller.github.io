This post doesn&#8217;t really have anything to do with autism, but the emphasis on making these gadgets accessible to those in wheel-chairs caught my eye. Both of these are from the [Wired](http://www.wired.com) magazine [Gear Factor](http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/#1508492) page today.

The car is controlled by joystick but tops out at around 25 mph&#8230;.
