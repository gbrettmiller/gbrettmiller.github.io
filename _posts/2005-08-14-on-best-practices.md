From [Organic KM](http://dineshtantri.blogspot.com/) (a blog I only recently discovered &#8211; thanks [Jack](http://blog.jackvinson.com/)) are some interesting thoughts on the nature of best practices:

> [Organic KM: Best Practices & Conventional Wisdom](http://dineshtantri.blogspot.com/2005/08/best-practices-conventional-wisdom.html): &#8220;The key challenge with Best Practices is that blind adherance to known and hopefully the most effective way of solving problems does not always yield expected results. A mismanaged Best Practices initiative might stifle the need to question conventional wisdom. &#8220;

Another post discussing &#8220;dynamic&#8221; best practices in the form of lessons learned comes from Patti at [Networks, Complexity, and Relatedness](http://www.byeday.net/weblog/networkblog.html):

> The core of the [AAR (After Action Review) process as it is practiced by the US Army&#8217;s National Training Center] is to elicit learnings from an experience that can be immediately applied in the next round of activities.

As a former Army officer, I can attest to the value of a well conducted AAR, especially in building the effectiveness of a team. The AAR, more than anything, is probably responsible for shaping my lack of faith in &#8220;Best Practices&#8221; as a static repository of the way things are done (except, of course, for those things that don&#8217;t change much over time).
