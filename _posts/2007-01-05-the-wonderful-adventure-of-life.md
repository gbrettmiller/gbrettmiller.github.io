In her post  [Everyday People](http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2006/12/everyday-people.html), abfh has the following to say about her &#8220;abnormal&#8221; behavior as a child:

> When I was a child, I often wandered away, climbed tall trees, played in traffic, and didn&#8217;t pay much attention to adults who told me that I was not behaving properly. That didn&#8217;t mean I had some sort of tragic and mysterious mental defect that made me incapable of social interaction, understanding danger, etc., and what&#8217;s more, I certainly wasn&#8217;t suffering or trying to escape from life. Quite the contraryâ€”<span style="font-weight:bold;">being alive seemed like a wonderful adventure, too precious and fascinating to be wasted sitting obediently in dull classrooms</span>. I got kicked out of several primary schools for wandering away when the teacher wasn&#8217;t looking, but I never thought that made me abnormal, either; I just thought schools were inhabited by narrow-minded conformists. I wanted to explore the world, going on brave quests like the kids in my favorite adventure stories. No doubt my view of life was absurdly melodramatic, but I&#8217;ll tell you what: Those who would describe my existence as a devastating tragedy are being far more absurd.

I can&#8217;t help but think of the [&#8220;unreasonable man&#8221; quote from Shaw that I wrote about a while back.](http://29marbles.blogspot.com/2005/03/unreasonable-man.html) It also brings to mind a commercial for I don&#8217;t know what product that shows kids &#8220;aspiring&#8221; to mediocrity (&#8220;I want to get stuck in middle management&#8221;). It makes we wonder about what we are teaching our children &#8211; autistic or not &#8211; about living this great adventure, both in our schools and as parents.

Everyone can be a &#8216;winner&#8217; (following on a theme in comments to Mike Stanton on a previous post), but not everyone can be a &#8216;winner&#8217; in the same thing. Everyone can experience the great adventure of life, but none of us have the same great adventure. The problem seems to be that we as a society are trending towards an homogeneous world in which we are all expected to &#8216;compete&#8217; in the same things, that we are all expected to have the same [Great Adventure](http://www.sixflags.com/parks/greatadventure/index.asp).

Which is unfortunate, but is it inevitable?
