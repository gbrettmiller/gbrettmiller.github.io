The anecdote [The Family Doctor](http://www.ageofautism.com/2007/12/the-family-doct.html) , published by <span><span>Julie Obradovic on </span></span>[Age of Autism](http://www.ageofautism.com) a couple of months back, is a well told story of how she finally succeeds in converting her brother, a pediatrician, to her understanding that vaccines are bad and likely a cause for autism. If you are new to the question of autism and its causes, and come across this story early on in your search for answers, chances are it might be pretty influential.

But something has been bugging me about the story since I first read it. I couldn&#8217;t quite put my finger on it, so I haven&#8217;t written about it until now. It was a discussion I had with [Autistic Bitch From Hell](http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/ "Whose Planet Is It Anyway?") in the [comments](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com/2008/04/a-view-from-the-middle/#comments) to my recent post [A View From the Middle](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com/2008/04/a-view-from-the-middle/ "29 Marbles - A view from the middle") that made me realize what was so troubling to me about the story.

Here are Obradovic&#8217;s brother&#8217;s thoughts on autism and an autistic child:

> <span><span>&#8220;I tell you, I would rather she got Polio than Autism. At least her mind would be in tact. At least she could talk to me, experience life with me. No offense, but some of the stories you send me about these kids? Well, if they were horses, they&#8217;d be put down just to ease their misery. What parent can watch that, or live with that? What child deserves that?&#8221;</span></span>

In other words, an autistic life is not worth living. And an autistic child is not worth parenting. With this mind-set, it is no wonder that they want to find a way to eradicate autism.

I just hope those of you trying to learn more about autism take this attitude into account when you read stories and opinions about vaccines as the cause of autism.
