&#8230;the [DVR box](http://www.moxi.com/home.htm "Moxi :: Home") I got from my [cable company](http://www.charter.com/Visitors/Home.aspx "Charter Communications") isn&#8217;t &#8216;smart&#8217; enough to adjust program recording times to accommodate earlier programs that go long? This is especially a problem on the weekends when sporting events go long, and shows start quite a bit after their regularly scheduled start time. Or is it that I&#8217;m not smart enough to figure out how to make it do this?
