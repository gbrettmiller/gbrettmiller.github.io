In the letter that he sent along with the early review copies of his new book [Linchpin: Are You Indispensable?](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591843162?ie=UTF8&tag=gbrettmiller-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1591843162), Seth Godin asks us to &#8220;read it through (twice if you can)&#8221; before we review it. I get the impression from his letter, and from his introduction to the book, that he expects many people won&#8217;t like it, or won&#8217;t agree with it, and that many people will stop reading before they finish.

From my point about 1/2 way through I can see why he might think that; some people are going to find his ideas and suggestions quite radical. I really hope those people who don&#8217;t agreee, or don&#8217;t understand, take the time to read the entire book and reflect deeply on what it says. They will come out better for it, even if they still don&#8217;t agree with what Seth says.

That&#8217;s all I&#8217;m going to say here about Linchpin for now, I am going to wait until I&#8217;ve had a chance to go through it twice and really absorb it before I write an actual review. If you want to know what others are already saying about the book, check out the [Linchpin lens](http://www.squidoo.com/linchpin) on [Squidoo](http://www.squidoo.com/linchpin).
