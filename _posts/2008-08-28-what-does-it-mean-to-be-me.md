This is the second of three posts of excerpts from [Elizabeth Moon](http://www.elizabethmoon.com/)&#8216;s novel [The Speed of Dark](http://www.speedofdark-thebook.com/). (Part one &#8211; [How normal are normal people?](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com/2008/08/how-normal-are-normal-peoplehow-normal-are-normal-people))

In this excerpt, Lou is considering what it means to be &#8220;Lou&#8221;, and how he would be different as an adult if he had been different when he was younger.

> If I had not been what I am, what would I have been? I have thought about that at times. If I had found it easy to understand what people were saying, would I have wanted to listen more? Would I have learned to talk more easily? And from that, would I have had more friends, even been popular? I try to imagine myself as a child, a normal child, chattering away with family and teachers and classmates. If I had been that child, instead of myself, would I have learned math so easily? Would the great complicated construction of classical music have been so obvious to me at first hearing? I remember the first time I heard Bach&#8217;s Toccata and Fugue in D Minor &#8230; the intensity of joy I felt. Would I have been able to do the work I do? And what other work might I have been able to do?

This particular scene resonated with me as I have had these same thoughts, from a parent&#8217;s point of view, as I&#8217;ve watched my son grow from a toddler to a 17-year old. (For examples, see [Thoughts on curing autism](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com/2005/04/thoughts-on-curing-autism/) and [Whose decision is it?](http://autism.gbrettmiller.com/2008/04/whose-decision-is-it/))
