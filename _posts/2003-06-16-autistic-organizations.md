Going through some of this stuff about organizational behavior, it struck me that if you look at many organizations as a [super-organism](http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/richerson/complex.PDF), and compare its behavior and characteristics to an individual human&#8217;s behavior (a stretch, I know), you will see an organization that looks very much like it is autistic.

You can see all the hallmarks: no theory of mind, overload (inability to effectively process) of information.
