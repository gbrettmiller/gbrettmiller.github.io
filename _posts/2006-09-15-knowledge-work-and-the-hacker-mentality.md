Are you a hacker? I am. And I&#8217;d be willing to bet that quite a few of you reading this are, as well. In fact, I think being a hacker is one of the skills/mindsets that is essential for a competent and successful knowledge worker today.

Of course, I&#8217;m referring to a hacker in the &#8220;old school&#8221; sense, as described by [Bruce Schneier](http://www.schneier.com "Schneier on Security"):

<blockquote title="Schneier on Security:  What is a Hacker?" cite="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/09/what_is_a_hacke.html">
  <p>
    A hacker is someone who thinks outside the box. It&#8217;s someone who discards conventional wisdom, and does something else instead. It&#8217;s someone who looks at the edge and wonders what&#8217;s beyond. It&#8217;s someone who sees a set of rules and wonders what happens if you don&#8217;t follow them. A hacker is someone who experiments with the limitations of systems for intellectual curiosity.

    Hackers are as old as curiosity, although the term itself is modern. Galileo was a hacker. Mme. Curie was one, too. Aristotle wasn&#8217;t. (Aristotle had some theoretical proof that women had fewer teeth than men. A hacker would have simply counted his wife&#8217;s teeth. A good hacker would have counted his wife&#8217;s teeth without her knowing about it, while she was asleep. A good bad hacker might remove some of them, just to prove a point.)

    Richard Feynman was a hacker; read any of his books.

It is in this vein that I claim to be a hacker, and that I claim that a hacker mindset is an important one for a successful knowledge worker. Tom Davenport notes the following about knowledge workers:

<blockquote title="Thomas Davenport - Thinking for a Living" cite="http://astore.amazon.com/gbrettmiller-20/detail/1591394236">
  <p>
    Knowledge workers have high degrees of expertise, education, or experience, and the primary purpose of their jobs involves the creation, distribution, orapplication of knowledge.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    [High-performers] engage in certain activities that keep them on the cutting edge of their own expertise and help them develop new capabilities as appropriate.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Many high-performers attributed problem-solving abilities to the acquisition of a broad base of knowledge. Knowing how one&#8217;s work impacts another department or function,seeing opportunities to collaborate or help solve a problem in another part of the organization, or understanding how two seemingly different kinds of expertise fit together were typical traits of high performers.

Sounds like a hacker to me. So I&#8217;ll ask again: Are you a hacker?
