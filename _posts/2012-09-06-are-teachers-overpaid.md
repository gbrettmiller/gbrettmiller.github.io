In the conversation around cutting government spending, the education system always seems to get caught in the middle. Especially the teachers. Do they get paid enough? Too much?

<!--more-->In the city of St. Louis, the average annual teacher salary in 2010 was 

[just under $50,000](http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/average-teacher-pay-in-missouri/html_b47f7a4e-6756-11df-8f35-0017a4a78c22.html?appSession=908137693751083 "St. Louis Post Dispatch - Teacher Pay"). Chances are that the parents of many students make significantly less than that, and that many make more that. Should that be a factor when deciding if teacher pay is &#8220;right&#8221;?

Or should their pay should be based on the value that they provide, compared to pay for similarly qualified people performing a similar service in the private sector? Is this what is meant by &#8220;running government like a business&#8221;?

What do you think, are teachers overpaid?
