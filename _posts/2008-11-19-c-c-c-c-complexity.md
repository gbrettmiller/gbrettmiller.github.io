As a [Systems Engineer](http://www.incose.org/practice/fellowsconsensus.aspx) working on a huge system-of-systems, complexity is a part of my daily life.  (I&#8217;m not complaining &#8211; I love it!).  But not everyone involved always recognizes the situation as complex, as opposed to simply complicated.  Of course, not everyone is in a position where they see the complexity; it all depends on your perspective.  But I think the people who will see the most success in life are those that put themselves in the position to see, understand, and take advantage of the complexity of things.

Anyway, here are the [5 C&#8217;s of complexity](http://www.cognitive-edge.com/blogs/dave/2008/10/5cs.php) from [Dave Snowden](http://www.cognitive-edge.com/files/David-Snowden.pdf "David-Snowden.pdf"):

  * **_Constraint_** is key to understanding complexity, it governs the transition between the three ontologies. Increase constraint and you create an ordered system; do that inappropriately and you create the conditions for catastrophic failure; remove constraint and the system is chaotic. Lightly constrain the system, while allowing it to be modified by the actors within it and you enable evolution and the emergence of meaning. Managing constrains is one of the things you can train managers to do, and measure their capability and effectiveness.
  * **_Coherence_** is the measure and concept by which you judge the validity of an action in a complex domain. A lightly constrained system modifies as agents interact with it, but it does constrain. The constant change means that is it difficult to provide absolute proof of an idea or approach (by the time you did the situation would have changed), but it is possible to create tests (including mathematical tests) of the degree of coherence that an idea has.
  * **_Connectivity_** is key to a complex system, where agent proximity has a massive impact on agent action. Of course the nature of connections is also key (just connecting things is not enough. If I increase connectivity I can increase variety and thence novelty by the right selection of links. But I can also increase connectivity of like with like if I want to exploit existing knowledge. I may generate a higher or lower degree of coherence, or at least test my ability to do so.
  * **_Context_** is vital. I remember a great advert for the Guardian newspaper. In the first scene you see a skinhead running towards a women; t_he perspective shifts_ and you see him about to grab a middle aged man with a briefcase; the _perspective shifts_ and you see him drag the man into the doorway before a skip of building material would have fallen on his head and killed him. We need to acknowledge perspective but it doesn&#8217;t follow that we can never be objective.
  * **_Coalescence_** is an alternative to categories which are all to common in management speak. We like to put things into little boxes so we have them properly organised. Its better to think about things as the centre of a coalescence with fussy boundaries Interestingly we are starting to understand that this is the nature of our own mind. Its a distributed function of our brain, hormones, nervous and tactile systems and in all probability toe environment. Categories lead to stereotyping, coalescence to meaning

Of course, the &#8220;C&#8221; that is missing is &#8220;complexity&#8221; itself.  But that is a much larger discussion.
