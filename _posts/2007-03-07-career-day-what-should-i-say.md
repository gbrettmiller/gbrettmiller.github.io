The guidance counselor at my son&#8217;s middle school called me last week and asked if I would be interested in coming in to talk to the eighth grade class at their upcoming career day. Of course I would love to do that, but it raises an interesting challenge for me. You see, I&#8217;m not exactly sure how to explain what exactly it is that I do.

A couple of years ago, in a post titled [&#8220;My Dad is a Knowledge Worker,&#8221;](http://nsl.blogspot.com/2004/09/my-dad-is-knowledge-worker.html "NSL (original) - My Dad is a Knowledge Worker") I addressed basically the same question:

> When my kids were finally old enough to ask me what I do, I told them simply, &#8220;I figure out how to solve problems.&#8221; That seemed to satisfy them, at least for now. Trying to explain to friends what I do everyday is a bit more difficult. When asked, I usually give my official job title, Systems Engineer. Of course, that instantly begs the question, &#8220;OK, but what do you do?&#8221;

I recently tried to explain, without much success I think, what I do at the most recent St. Louis Idea Market using only a diagram (visualization exercise) and 5 words or less. Yeah, right.

I asked my son for advice on what to say, what he thought would be something that he and his classmates would like to hear. He&#8217;s going to get back to me. I&#8217;m starting to think that instead of addressing my current job, it may be more useful to talk about how I got to where I am. After all, these kids are going to be much more interested in how to get started than in where they&#8217;re going to be when they are in their 40&#8217;s (man, that&#8217;s old!)

Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.
