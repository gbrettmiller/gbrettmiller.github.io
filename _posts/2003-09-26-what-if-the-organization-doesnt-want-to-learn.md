Anticipated learning from the Foundations for Leadership course mentioned before:  


> The special contribution of this leadership course comes as people discover the profound connections between **personal mastery** and systems thinking, seeing that **deep change in our social systems and in oneself** are inseparable from each other.

For the target audience of the course, this is perfect. Anyone willing to take the three days and spend the tuition obviously wants to gain personal mastery and affect a deep change in themselves and social systems. And these people are typically the leaders, whether formal or not, of an organization that they want to change.

Unfortunately, the members of an organization &#8211; especially a large and well established (ie, old) organization &#8211; may not have this same desire. How does an organization overcome this lack of interest and turn it into the burning desire to grow and excel that is the trademark of a learning organization?

In a word: LEADERSHIP.
