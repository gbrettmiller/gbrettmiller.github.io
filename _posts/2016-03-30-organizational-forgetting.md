excerpt: I finally realized one day that the problem has become not, “How do we remember all this knowledge that we’ve learned?” but rather, “How do we forget all this knowledge we’ve accumulated that we no longer need so we can focus on what we do need?”

I [wrote the following](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/2005/technology-makes-it-easy-to-remember-the-trick-is-learning-how-to-forget-2) back in November 2005:

> My early days in Knowledge Management included a lot of time developing, deploying, and getting people to use “knowledge repositories.” (At least _trying_ to get people to use them.) A worthwhile endeavor in some regards, I’ve always had misgivings about the whole idea, at least how it has been implemented in most cases. The cheapness of mass storage these days, and the way we just keep everything, has nagged at this misgiving over the past couple of years.

That post also included a reference to memory and forgetting in the human mind, taken from the book [The Trouble with Tom](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0045I6TOE/gbrettmiller-20) by Paul Collins:

> Memory is a toxin, and its overretention – the constant replaying of the past – is the hallmark of stress disorders and clinical depression. The elimination of memory is a bodily function, like the elimination of urine. Stop urinating and you have renal failure: stop forgetting and you go mad.

I [explored this idea a bit further](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/2007/technology-makes-it-easy-to-remember-the-trick-is-learning-how-to-forget) in March 2007, where I added the following to my thinking:

> In the context of mastery, especially of something new, it is sometimes hard to know when to forget what you’ve learned. You have to build up a solid foundation of basic knowledge, the things that have to be done. And at some point you start to build up [tacit knowledge](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/2007/thoughts-on-knowledge-management-and-knowledge-work "NSL: Thoughts on knowledge management and knowledge work") of what you are trying to master. And this, the tacit knowledge that goes into learning and mastery, is probably the hardest thing to learn how to forget.
> 
> Sometimes, though, it is critical to forget what you know so you can continue to improve.

And [yet again](http://nsl.gbrettmiller.com/2009/the-importance-of-forgetting) in June 2009:

> I’m at a point now, though, where the project is going through significant changes, almost to the point of being a “new” project. My dilemma: How to “forget” the parts of the old project that are no longer important and start with an “empty mind” to build up the new project without the baggage of the old.

I was reminded of this train of thought today when a colleague shared a link to a TEDx talk by [Pablo Martin de Holan](http://www.em-lyon.com/en/faculty-research-education/faculty-research/international-business-school-professors/Permanent-Professors/Pablo-MARTIN-DE-HOLAN) titled [Managing Organizational Forgetting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NzgEwye6Uk), based on a paper of the same name [published in the MIT Sloan Management Review](http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/managing-organizational-forgetting/). If you read my quotes above, I&#8217;m sure you understand why this opening paragraph from the paper grabbed my attention (emphasis at the end is mine):

> <p style="text-align:left;">
>   Over the last decade, companies have become increasingly aware of the value of managing their organizational knowledge, and researchers have investigated those processes extensively. Indeed, the ways in which organizations learn and have stocks of knowledge that underlie their capabilities can be a powerful tool in explaining the behavior and competitiveness of companies. Yet something is missing in the current discussions of organizational knowledge: <strong>Companies don’t just learn; they also forget.</strong><br /> <cite>&#8212;<a href="http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/managing-organizational-forgetting/">Pablo Martin de Holan</a> </cite>
> </p>

There is a lot of great info in the paper (about 12 pages worth), but for now I&#8217;ll just mention the two modes of forgetting &#8211; Accidental and Intentional. Obviously, you will want to limit the former and maximize the benefit of the latter. At the risk of a giant spoiler (you should still take the time to read the full paper), de Holan summarizes nicely:

> Some companies forget the things they need to know, incurring huge costs to replace the lost knowledge. Other organizations can’t forget the things they should, and they remain trapped by the past, relying on uncompetitive technologies, dysfunctional corporate cultures or untenable assumptions about their markets. Successful companies instead are able to move quickly to adapt to rapidly changing environments by being skilled not only at learning, but also at forgetting. Indeed, as companies work to increase their capacity to learn they also need to develop a corresponding ability to forget. Otherwise, they could easily be learning counterproductive knowledge, such as bad habits. The bottom line is that companies need to manage their processes for forgetting as well as for learning, because only then can they deploy their organizational knowledge in the most effective ways for achieving sustained competitive advantage.

I really wish I had come across this paper back in Winter 2004 when it was published. I&#8217;ve got a lot of catching up to do.

And for those of you interested in the TEDx talk, here you go.
