In their book [**Rework**](http://37signals.com/rework "REWORK: The new business book from 37signals"), the guys from [37signals](http://37signals.com "Web-based collaboration apps for small business") make a compelling argument for staying small in a chapter called &#8220;Why grow?&#8221; My favorite quote from that chapter:

> Small is not just a stepping stone. Small is a great destination in itself.

And this isn&#8217;t just empty talk from someone trying to sell books, this is how they actually run the company. From [a recent article on Fast Company](http://www.fastcompany.com/3000852/37signals-earns-millions-each-year-its-ceo%E2%80%99s-model-his-cleaning-lady "37signals Earns Millions Each Year. Its CEO’s Model? His Cleaning Lady"), here is 37signals CEO Jason Fried ([@jasonfried](https://twitter.com/jasonfried "Jason Fried - It's simple until you make it complicated")):

> I’m a fan of growing slowly, carefully, methodically, of not getting big just for the sake of getting big. I think that rapid growth is typically of symptom of&#8230; there’s a sickness there. There’s a great quote by a guy named Ricardo Semler, author of the book _<a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/maverick-success-story-behind-the-worlds-most-unusaul-work-place-ricardo-semler/1104291050?ean=9780446670555" target="_blank">Maverick</a>_. He said that only two things grow for the sake of growth: businesses and tumors. We have 35 employees at 37signals. We could have hundreds of employees if we wanted to&#8211;our revenues and profits support that&#8211;but I think we’d be worse off.

This is kind of a follow up to yesterday&#8217;s post, [Living life for a living](http://artofliving.gbrettmiller.com/living-life-for-a-living/ "Living life for a living"), which got me thinking again about the 37signals philosophy. What it really comes down to, it seems, is the difference between a **businessperson** &#8211; who wants to run a business that makes money; big is better &#8211; and a **person in business** &#8211; who wants to build a business around something they do; the bigger the business gets, the less they get to do what they got into business for in the first place.
