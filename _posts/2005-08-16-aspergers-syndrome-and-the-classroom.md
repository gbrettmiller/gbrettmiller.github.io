As the number of autistic kids rises, the ability of the public school systems to adequately provide for them becomes increasingly strained. This is especially true for kids in &#8220;regular&#8221; classrooms, as described in [Asperger&#8217;s Syndrome And The Classroom](http://www.waff.com/Global/story.asp?S=3639082&nav=0hBEcYdf): 

> More and more autistic children are in regular classrooms. But even though these Autistic children may look like any other, they&#8217;re not. And many teachers don&#8217;t know how to adapt to the difference.

It is an unfortunate reality that most teachers&#8217; training and experience encompasses only a &#8220;normal&#8221; classroom, where all the kids at least understand the way things are supposed to work (even if they choose not to adhere to it). And this is understandable, from a teacher&#8217;s point of view, because that is the way most public schools are set up to operate.

Which means we need to change the way most public school systems operate. I think the teachers &#8211; the good ones, anyway &#8211; are up to it.
