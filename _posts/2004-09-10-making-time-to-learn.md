From [Learning and Training Innovations](http://www.ltimagazine.com) magazine is the article [Making Time to Learn](http://www.ltimagazine.com/ltimagazine/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=120839). The author presents several approaches to overcome the problem &#8220;lack of time is the major impediment to learning,&#8221; including:

  * Make learning an official, voiced company or unit goal (iow, Give your employees permission to learn) 
      * Link training explicitly to individual goals 
          * Tie training to annual performance reviews</ul> 
            A key quote from the article:
            
            > Many companies understand the links between ongoing learning, a knowledgeable workforce, high performance, and ultimate business success. Truly enlightened companies also walk the talk. They make professional development a voiced, company goal, and they support the **alignment of corporate, unit, and individual goals** _(emphasis added by me)_. Continued learning is an expectation and often a requirement- whether a course required upon becoming a manager, training for specific skills required for a new task, or a training program tied to a company event, such as budgeting, or to a company initiative, such as a change effort.
            
            A lot of discussion of KM involves the relative value/importance of organizational vs. personal KM. A focus on aligning all aspects of the KM spectrum, as in the learning example here, I think is a more appropriate approach than a focus on any single aspect. Obviously, each individual area needs a focus to improve performance at that level, but only if it is not at the expense of the whole effort.
